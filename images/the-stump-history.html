living on the shores of Sebago Lake that I decided to put together the
information I had at the time regarding my family ancestry. Beverly and I had
moved to a condominium on the lake after retiring and the peace and tranquility
set itself to the task. As I began to assemble what was at hand, I found much
was missing. For the next few years we traveled to towns and villages of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gathering information and
historical data to create this document. Doing the research we meet with
librarians, curators, and guides, of which many were also distant cousins. The
genealogy section in the library at the University Of Moncton, New Brunswick,
Canada contained volumes of pertinent information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>After assembling the data and taking notes by hand the task of putting
it together was before me. We moved back to South Portland where we had lived
for so many years. I purchased a computer and self taught my way into the
technology. Over 7000 names have been entered into my database and are
available with this script. This document has been a great experience
formulating and fortune came to us by meeting many of my distant relatives. The
name of the document comes from an expression that a befriended distant cousin
would refer to when I would ask if a Legere in the town were related to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The search of my heritage primarily starts with the first settlers that
came to North America with a few references to earlier ancestors. For a better
understanding of this heritage, I formulated this script into a synopsis of
Acadia history. It also includes many resumes of early ancestral settlers,
direct line ancestors and my immediate family. Although this script deals
primarily with my paternal ancestors you will find many maternal ancestors of
my father, Philip J. Legere and mother, Marie L. Hamanne. I have also done the
research of the ancestors of Beverly J. Hall, my wife. There are genealogy
tables and charts available with this text for all three families. It is
fascinating to navigate through the charts following the direct ancestral
line.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>During the 16th century and well into the next century the French crowns
did not enthusiastically support colonization in the New World. However, other
European Countries took stronger interest and supported their explorers with
more financial backing and necessary arms. The Government or Social order
during this period of time in France was Feudalism and therefore extended into
the New World. The Crown awarded fiefdoms to Seigneurs together with titles and
powers of a dictator. The lords granted farms from the lands of the fiefdom and
the inhabitants in turn owed feudal dues, difference, labor and armed
protection. The Seigneurs oversaw justice and protected the tenants. Feudal Law
was loosely practice because of the landmasses and few people occupying the
fiefdoms. This society existed until 1670 when Hector d’Andigne de
Grandfontaine became governor of all Canada, including Acadia, which then
became a Royal Province. However, feudalism did linger in a small way as the
inhabitants had no other social governing experience. Fur trade dominated the
North American continent with fishing the major commerce along the eastern
shores. French explorers made some attempts at colonizing, but without adequate
monetary backing from the Crown, the fisheries and fur trade would have to
support the colonization. Stormy cold winters also contributed greatly to the
lack of enthusiasm and success.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

ships and 61 men landed at Gaspe’ and claimed Canada for France in 1534. The
following year he returned and explored the St. Lawrence River to where
Montreal is now located. Harsh weather caused hardship and 25 men were lost
before he returned to France. Colonization was attempted by Jean Francois de la
Rougue between 1541 and 1543, but the lack of backing from French Royalty
caused its failure. Jacques Noel, a nephew of Jacques Cartier, obtained a
short-lived trade monopoly in 1588 even though Bretoner Troilus de Mesgouez,
Sieur de La Roche, had jurisdiction over the territory as Lieutenant Governor
and Viceroy. Noel confirmed that private enterprise supported by trade, mainly furs,
would be the key to successful colonization in North America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the territories of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Cape Breton Island and Nova
Scotia Peninsular; the Maliseets and Passamaquoddies Indian Tribes along the Bay
of Fundy and New Brunswick; and the Penobscot and Abenakis Indians in Maine.
Europeans started fishing “The Banks” of the North Atlantic at the beginning of
the 16th century. By the end of the century hundreds of vessels were fishing
the area. Fisherman would go ashore and dry their fish before the long return
voyage to their homeport. Trade with the Indians for furs began to spread.
European fisherman and traders brought disease with them and Indians died by
the thousands, leaving 3000 Micmacs, 1000 Maliseets and Passamaquoddies and
12,000 Abenakis. This was one tenth of the previous Indian population and their
culture began to fail. The Micmacs were tranquil people with a very simple way
of life. They confronted both British and French colonists, but liked and got
along with the French settlers because they were also tranquil and the French
tolerated the Indian culture. In later years the Indians would side with the
French in war against the British.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Island was settled with 60 men and women lead by Bretoner Troilus de Mesgouez
in 1598. The winter weather was extremely bad and along with scurvy (lack of
vitamin C) only 11 men survived the winter. The remaining survivors returned to
France leaving the island abandoned. In 1599 a 10-year monopoly for furs in
Canada was granted to Pierre Chauvin de Thonnetuit. The following year he led
an expedition and founded a settlement on Cape Tadoussac at the mouth of the
St. Lawrence and the Saguanay Rivers. A fur trading post was established and
the colony would also be a base for the Catholic Missionaries. Among the men
with him was; Francois Grave Du Pont, a sea captain; Samuel de Champlain, a
pilot and geographer; and Pierre Du Gua de Monts, adventurer. During the winter
of 1600-1601 Pierre Chauvin left 16 men at the colony. The weather again was
disastrous and most of the men died. Those who did survive were returned to
France in 1601. Pierre Chauvin continued his exploration of Canada and made a
trip up the St. Lawrence River in 1603 before he died. Aymar de Chaste,
Governor of Dieppe, France, was to take over Chauvin’s explorations, but he
also died after his first expedition sailed from France. Therefore, neither of
these explorers was successful at their attempts to colonize in the New World.<span style="mso-tab-count:7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

territory of the New World in which the French explorers were attempting to
colonize became known as Acadia. The origin of this name supposedly is derived
from two different sources. One is the Micmac word for quoddy or cady, a track
of land. Henry IV of France called it La Cadie, which became known as Acadie in
French and translates to Acadia in English. The original grant by King Henry IV
of France included land from Philadelphia to Cape Breton. However, when the
French began to develop these lands in North America they claimed as Acadia;
the territories now known as Nova Scotia including Cape Breton, Prince Edward
Island, New Brunswick, Gaspe Peninsula, the St. Lawrence Valley and the State
of Maine west to the Kennebec River. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to develop Acadia. He was made Seigneur of Acadia, given a 10 year monopoly of
the fur trade and organized a trading company. Gua de Monts had been with
Chauvin on an earlier voyage. He brought with him on this new venture Jean de
Biencourt de Poutrincourt and hired Samuel de Champlain. In the spring of that
year de Monts outfitted two ships and set sail with 120 men. He commanded one
ship and Francois Grave Du Pont, who also was with Chauvin in 1603, commanded
the other ship. De Monts made landfall on the coast of Nova Scotia at Cape La
Have and sailed on to Liverpool and Port Mouton. He sent out a search for Grave
Du Pont and directed Camplain to explore Cape Sable and the Bay of Fundy.
Champlain sailed past Yarmouth and on to St. Mary’s Bay. He then returned to
rendezvous with de Monts. Grave Du Pont had been located and de Monts sent him
on to the St. Lawrence River. De Monts together with Poutrincourt and Champlain
sailed around Cape Sable to St. Mary’s Bay and left some of his men. After
looking Saint Mary’s Bay over, he was not satisfied and sailed on probing the
eastern shores of the Bay of Fundy, passing up Port Royal, Minas Basin and
Chignecto Bay. They continued along the shores of New Brunswick to the St.
John’s River, Passamaquoddy Bay and St. Croix Island. Because of its logistic
location he decided to build his settlement on the island and brought the men
from St. Mary’s Bay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Poutrincourt and Grave Du Pont returned to France on the ocean sailing ship
with a cargo of fur and fish. De Monts and Champlain stayed at St. Croix
Island. Champlain explored Mount Desert Island, Penobscot Bay to Bangor and the
coast of Maine to the mouth of the Kennebec River. Champlain returned to St.
Croix in October and spent the winter with de Monts and 77 men. The winter
turned out to be a disaster and 35 of the men died. Isolation, the inability to
get off the island because of storms and ice left them short of adequate food
and fuel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

returned with 60 new colonists. During the summer de Monts and Champlain
continue exploring to the south; The Kennebec River, Merrymeeting Bay, Casco
Bay, Saco Bay, Cape Ann, Boston Harbor, Charles River, and Plymouth Bay to
Eastham on Cape Cod. They found that Captain George Weymouth on the British
ship “Archangel” had also been exploring the Maine coast and encountered
skirmishes with the Indians. When they returned to St. Croix in late summer, de
Monts moved his settlement to Port Royal establishing the first permanent French
Colony in North America. The post and town was situated on the Nova Scotia
peninsular, along the west shore of the bay now known as Annapolis Bay and
southwest of Annapolis Royal. Today at this location can be found the Port
Royal National Historic Site, a replica of the original post. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of 1605 after he had built his new colony. He took with him the survivors of
the previous winter. He had to attend to the affairs of the company in order to
retain his 10-year monopoly. Grave Du Pont was left in charge along with
Champlain. They got through the winter well, as they didn’t have the isolation
problems of being on an island. Food, fuel and shelter were more plentiful.
They made friends with Chief Membertou of the Micmac Indians. That certainly
helped them through the first winter at Port Royal. In the spring the following
year Champlain attempted to leave on additional explorations, but was hampered
by inexperienced seamen which caused a couple groundings of his ship while
navigating out of the Port Royal Basin.. At the same time, de Monts was still
in France and readying the ship “Jonas” with supplies and more men for the
French colony. He had difficulty signing new men because of the stories told by
men of previous voyages. It was necessary to increase the wages to get the
appropriate volunteers. Before the ship was ready to leave port it was blown
against the sea wall causing damage and further delay. When they were finally
ready to sail on the “Jonas” in late spring 1606, de Monts appointed
Poutrincourt his commander who had enlisted his son Charles de Biencourt de
Saint-Just to join him. Also included in this expedition were de Monts’ lawyer,
Marc Lescarbot and a cousin named Lewis Hebert. Back in Acadia, those that
stayed for the winter were awaiting de Monts return and when he didn’t return
by July, all but two men left Port Royal with intent to return to France. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Acadia and made landfall at Canso. He sent a small boat out to find Grave Du
Pont and located him and the others at Cape Sable. They all then returned to
Port Royal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>De Monts wanted to find a
more suitable location so he sent Poutrincourt and Champlain exploring to the
south. They got as far south as Cape Cod. There they meet with unfriendly
Indians and returned to Port Royal as it was getting late in the fall for any
further explorations. In the mean time, de Monts and Du Pont returned to France
on the ship “Jonas”. The remaining men in Port Royal were treated with a pageant
directed by Lescarbot when Poutrincourt and Champlain returned. It was agreed
that Port Royal would be the best location for the colony and a fur trading
post in Acadia. There was much partying the winter of 1606-1607, as the weather
was quite mild. A few men were lost, but there was much improvement the in
living conditions at the colony. However, the production of furs and trade
suffered. Large debts were run up and the company was in trouble. Poutrincourt
was called back to France by the merchants backing him in the fur trade and
were withdrawing their support. He delayed his return as long as possible to
muster some success, but to no avail, and the fur trade monopoly was taken away
from de Monts. During the summer of 1607, Port Royal was left to the Indians
for a short time. The wars between the Indian tribes started, but the French
were able to stay neutral.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

James River, Virginia and had been exploring northeast as far as the Kennebec
River. As early as 1607 they were starting their oppression in North America.
The following year they abandoned their adventures in the Acadian territory, as
they could not get along with the Indians like the French did. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>France still had some hopes in de Monts. He
shifted sights toward the Saint Lawrence because that area would be a more
productive fur territory being further north. He commissioned 3 ships in 1608
sending Champlain and Du Pont to the Saint Lawrence where they settled at
Quebec and developed a fur trading post. Champdore, the pilot who had grounded
the ships back at Port Royal in 1606, returned to Port Royal with the third
ship. He was then sent on to Saco where he was to negotiate peace between the
Abenakis and Micmac Indian tribes who were at war with each other. However the
peace didn’t last as the Indian wars continued until 1617. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Port Royal and de Monts at Quebec with Champlain and Du Pont; Poutrincourt
remained in France lobbying King Henry IV for a seigneurie at Port Royal. The
Recollet Priest had accompanied de Monts on the earlier voyages to the new
continent. Reverend Pierre Coton of the Society of Jesus was the spiritual
director and confessor of the court and being in the court’s favor, the court
wanted the Jesuits to bring the Catholic Religion to Acadia rather than the
Recollet Priest. Poutrincourt was granted the seigneurie providing he agrees to
bring with him a member of The Society of Jesus to converts the Acadian natives
to Catholicism. Rev. Pierre Coton assigned the Jesuit Priest Pierre Biard.
Poutrincourt didn’t like the Jesuits or want the Jesuits to go with him so he
procrastinated as long as he could. He convinced Rev. Coton in 1608 that the
time was premature for their work in Acadia even though the Recollets had been
there before and had baptized many of the Indians. By 1610 Poutrincourt finally
organized his expedition and set sail on his ship “Grace de Dieu”. Included in
this expedition were a secular priest, Rev. Jesse Fleche, Claude de
Saint-Etienne de La Tour, La Tour’s 17-year-old son Charles, and Poutrincourt’s
son Charles de Biencourt. Arriving in Port Royal, Poutrincourt had his fiefdom

within. Marie de Medici was the regent for the King, Louis XIII, and the child
king. The Jesuits had a patroness named Antoinette de Pons Marquise de
Guercheville at the Queens (Marie de Medici) side. As a result of this
connection, Biencourt was directed to return to Port Royal with the Jesuits,
Fr. Pierre Biard and Fr. Enemond Masse. When the outfitters of the ship heard
of this, they refused to supply the ship so Guercheville bought them out. The
Jesuits were assigned and also became partners of the company and were to share
the profits of the company. These negotiations delayed the sailing until
January 1611 and therefore, the ship did not arrive in Port Royal until May
1611. By then other traders had already taken large amounts of furs reducing profits
for this newly formed company. After their arrival in Acadia the Jesuits
presence caused strife and disagreements among the settlers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

settlement was established at Saint Sauveur, today known as Somes Sound on
Mount Desert Island, Maine. Captain Samuel Argall raided this settlement with the
British war ship “Treasurer” in July 1613. Argall captured the French settlers

he didn’t have it easy after he got the backing of the Company of New France.
Sir Ferdinendo Gorges, the Council for New England, in 1621 had parceled out
the northeast part of North America to Scotland so that they would have to deal
with the French in Acadia. Sir William Alexander of Scotland desired to
colonize for King James I and had gone as far as Newfoundland in 1622 where he
sheltered for the winter. After loosing many men he gave up and returned to
Scotland. He made two more attempts in 1624 and 1625, but was again
unsuccessful. King James I had tried to get subjects to go to the New World by
appointing barons, but still had trouble convincing people to go. When King
James I died, King Charles of Scotland became a supporter of colonizing in
Canada as well. King Charles took the same line to promote colonizing, but with
more force and made it easier for the barons to take their titles by making Nova
Scotia a part of Scotland. He also supported them with some financial

Massachusetts and the Plymouth Bay Colony received a grant to the Penobscot Bay

Augusta and Pentagoet (now Castine, Me.) while venturing as far East to Machias
for fur trade. The post at Pentagoet was taken over by Isaac Allerton

D’Aulnay was not liked, but Razilly was in control. Samuel de Champlain, with a

settlers and soldiers of Acadia were brave and courageous people. They taunted
and raided the Pilgrim outpost at Penobscot and Machias because they were
occupying French territory. Razilly sent D’Aulnay to peaceably enforce French
claim to Penobscot Bay in August 1635. It was at first successful, but the
Pilgrims were not happy with the situation, so they sent Captain Miles Standish

adopted a method of farming similar to that in the Netherlands. They built dikes,
called aboiteaux, along the shores of the extreme tides of the Bay of Fundy.
Under the dikes they installed wooden sluices with top hinged gates. On an
incoming tide the force of the water would close the gate not allowing the
seawater onto the drained land. Rain water, fresh spring water and water from
streams would flush the land and drain out through the sluices at low tide. The
rich soil would then be exposed for farming and grazing. This way of preparing
the land required far less labor than the conventional way of clearing the land
of trees and rocks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the upper hand in Acadia. The Kings ministers tried to appease the Seigneurs of
Acadia, but it didn’t work like it was suppose to, as the lords had overlapping
territories unknown by the ministers of France. Charles La Tour married an
Indian woman and they had two daughters. A third marriage in 1640 was to
Francoise-Marie Jacqueline an actress and daughter of a physician from the
Paris suburbs. Upon his return to Acadia with his new wife, he went to Port
Royal to meet D’Aulnay and Jean Motin. Arriving there he found that D’Aulnay
was on a voyage to Pentagoet visiting his captain of the arms, Germain Doucet.
D’Aulnay had left orders not to allow La Tour ashore while he was gone. This
upset La Tour and they had a battle when D’Aulnay returned. La Tour was
defeated and both he and his wife were jailed by D’Aulnay. He later released
them and allowed them to return to Saint John. The ministers tried again to

Puritans for the future, but was unable to get any other financial backing
there. In 1642 D’Aulnay sailed to France, got control of the Razilly-Condonnier
Company and obtained financial backing from Emmanuel Le Borgne. He then hired
men and ships and returned to Acadia with orders in hand to arrest La Tour.
Rather than confront La tour directly, D’Aulnay though it best to set up a
blockade of Fort La Tour and Saint John Harbor, cutting off supplies to La
Tour. Jacques de Murat, a Lieutenant of La Tour’s was able to get by the blockade
and sail to Boston. There he convinced the Puritans of Boston to commence
immediate commercial trade with the papists at Saint John. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Canada. As in Acadia, the culture of the inhabitants in Quebec also surrounded
the church. Marguerite could have been related to Jacques Bourgeois, but this
was not researched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

standing arrest warrant for Charles La Tour, so he stayed in the comfort of his
fort at Saint John and sent his wife to France to see if she could reverse his
position in Acadia. Richelieu had died and Jules Mazarin replaced him as the
King’s Minister. Madam La Tour was successful as Mazarin reversed the arrest
decree and reinstated La Tour’s title. Orders were also issued for a ship and
supplies to aid La Tour. The 120-ton ship “Saint Cement” sailed with 63 men to
reinforce Charles La Tour and the official papers restoring La Tour‘s
commission. They arrived off the shores of Saint John and confronted the
blockade by D’Aulnay. Francoise-Marie Jacqueline was able to get a message
ashore to her husband and he along with Jacques Murat found their way to the
ship and set sail for Boston arriving on June 22, 1644. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Boston, La Tour produced the documents and was able to convince Governor
Winthrop and his advisors that he was the legal Governor of Acadia. They
declined to become involved directly, but allowed La Tour to hire men and ships
in Massachusetts to go with him and take back Acadia by force. The clergy and
elders of the Puritan colony had not been consulted and were upset with
Winthrop’s decision. But, it was too late to reverse. They were drawn into an
armed conflict of the French colony and did not understand why they became involved,
political or religious. Boston merchants Edward Gibbons and Thomas Hawkins were
La Tour’s financial backers, holding a mortgage on Fort La Tour. Five ships
were outfitted with supplies, crews and 70 hired soldiers. This armada of ships
was to accompany the ship “Clement” sailing under her flag. When returning to
the Bay of Fundy, La Tour meet the blockade with little resistance and followed
D’Aulnay’s ships to Port Royal. After entering the basin on that summer day of
1643, La Tour sent for D’Aulnay’s surrender. In turn D’Aulnay returned with the
outstanding warrant for La Tour’s arrest. Seeing this, Hawkins had second
thoughts about his involvement and would not order an attack, but allowed La
Tour to recruit volunteers. La Tour was able to enlist about one half of the
soldiers to join him with the promise of booty. An assault was launched with
minimal success. Before retreating, a mill was burned, a few crops destroyed, a
few cattle killed, three defenders killed, seven men wounded and one soldier
captured. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

longer wanted anything to do with La Tour. Additionally he was in bad favor
with the French because he had been in armed conflict against his countrymen
and the Protestants of Boston sided with him. D’Aulnay went to France in the
fall of 1643 to undo what Mazarin had done for La Tour and his wife. D’Aulnay
returned to Acadia with a war ship, reinforcements and another arrest warrant
for Charles La Tour. Francoise-Marie Jacqueline had gone back to France also, but
was not received as she had hoped to be. Finding no sympathy with the hostile
administration, she found her way to London. There she hired Captain John
Bradley to bing her back to Saint John. Because of other voyage commitments,
six months later the vessel arrived in Boston. Charles La Tour had been in
Boston just a few days prior to her arrival. He again was trying to get
financial backing from the people of Massachusetts. Madam La Tour sued Captain
Bradley for breach of contract and was awarded the ships cargo. With the money
from the sale of the cargo she was able to buy supplies and hire another ship
to return her to Saint John.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Governor D‘Aulnay was able to make amends with the Puritans. A treaty
was signed October 18, 1644 between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Acadia. It
recognized D’Aulnay the Governor of Acadia, assured peace between the two
colonies and permitted unlimited merchant trading. D’Aulnay was also allowed to
maintain his blockade of Fort La Tour. However, Charles La Tour would not give
in easily. The people of Boston liked him, so he and his wife put together
another plan to present to the Puritans. La Tour left for Boston in the spring
of 1645. D’Aulnay heard of his absence from Fort La Tour and took the
opportunity to attack the fort. Francoise-Marie Jacqueline, the wife of Charles
La Tour, strongly led the defense of the fort. The battle lasted for three days
and there were many casualties. Fort La Tour finally fell under siege on Easter
of 1645. All but one of La Tour’s men was hanged while Madam La Tour was made
to watch. She was put in prison and died June 15,1645. Charles La Tour in
defeat went to Newfoundland to enlist help from his father’s old friend David
Kirke. Unable to get any assistance there, he went into exile at Quebec.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The French Colonies of Acadia were growing from the people Razilly
brought, some of D’Aulnay’s immigrants and a generation of the new Acadian
born. Those that came from France were mostly from the counties of Tourine and
Brittany. D’Aulnay had his forts, private armies, and control of the fur trade
and wealth. Most of the colonists and a few soldiers resided at Port Royal.
There were still a few settlers at La Have and others at D’Aulnay’s controlled
forts. Nicholas Denys returned to Acadia to build a post at Chaleur Bay in what
is now northeast New Brunswick and D’Aulnay again put him out of business.
There were about 300 people in the territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

early 1650 D’Aulnay died in the cold waters of Port Royal as a result of a
canoeing accident. D’Aulnay settlements got scrambled as civil strife plagued
the homeland France during the “Fonde”. Emmanuel Le Borgne not able to see a
return of his investment in D’Aulnay looted the warehouse at Port Royal. He
then took over the colony, acting as “The Lord of Acadia“. Denys had again
relocated at Cape Breton Island and Le Borgne forced him into exile at Quebec.
Le Borgne also had Charles La Tour to contend with as he came out of exile from
Quebec and took the opportunity of D’Aulnay’s death to regain political
presence. France again renewed their faith in La Tour, as he was made Governor
of Acadia and returned to Port Royal in September 1651. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Jeanne Motin, the widow of D’Aulnay, was in trouble as her support from
France had fallen apart. When La Tour returned to Acadia he forced Jeanne Motin
to turn over Saint John Harbor and the new forts her husband had built. He then
made his base there. Denys again came back relocating at Saint Peters {Cape Breton
Island}. Le Borgne raided Port Royal for its goods a second time in the winter
of 1652-1653. In the spring of 1653 Charles La Tour proposed to Jeanne Motin
and married her in July. She was 30 years younger and the widow of his
archrival. Soon after the wedding while La Tour was at Saint John, Le Borgne
returned again to Port Royal and took control of that settlement. He placed
Jeanne Motin in prison, went on to raid La Have and Denys’ post at Saint
Peters. This time Nicholas Denys was placed in a dungeon shackled in irons.
However, Denys was able to get free and returned to France. The Company of New
France awarded the inlands and coast of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from Canso
to Gaspe’, including Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Island to Nicholas Denys.
Along with the backing of the Company of New France he was given Governorship
of the same territory by the French Crown. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the end of 1654 Acadia was a scrambled mess with the Governorships and
commissions, Charles La Tour at Saint John, Nicholas Denys at Saint Peters and
Emmanuel Le Borgne at Port Royal. The Puritan political party controlled
Britain as well as New England from 1642 to 1648.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>King Henry VIII and Parliament fought a civil
war. The Parliament won and the king was beheaded. Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan,
became “The Lord Protector” and ruled until 1660. The “Navigation Act”, banning
British imports except in British ships limited Dutch trade. After a century of
Spanish rule over the Dutch, Holland became a nation and built their own
merchant fleet. In 1652 war between Britain and the Dutch started. The war
lasted for only two years because Cromwell did not like the conflict with other
protestant nations. Robert Sedgwick together with John Leverett had prepared an
armada of ships and trained soldiers from New England to take Manhattan from
the Dutch. The war ended before the planned assault on Manhattan took place, so
they had the trained forces and supplies ready for an attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>French privateers were very active in the Atlantic Ocean seizing British
ships even though Britain and France were at peace. Britain was under the
leadership of the Puritans and Cromwell commissioned Robert Sedgwick to seize
French ships in reprisal. Robert Sedgwick interpreted this commission as the
approval to conquer Acadia. Based on that, Sedgwick decide to invade French
Acadia with his trained troops and armada of ships. In the summer of 1654 he
sailed to the Bay of Fundy, first to Saint John where he accepted Charles La
Tour’s surrender after three days of minimal fighting. He then sailed across
the bay to Port Royal where Emmanuel Le Borgne gave up after a small skirmish.
Sedgwick then went on to take possession of La Have and Pentagoet. Nicholas
Denys was let be at Saint Peters, probably to far away to bother with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Acadia was now governed by Britain and the inhabitant’s British
subjects. Charles La Tour was sent to Britain and Emmanuel Le Borgne to France
with the soldiers of Port Royal. Among them were Germain Doucet, Jacques
Bourgeois I and his son Robert who had arrived in the early sixteen thirties.
The inhabitants of the settlements had a choice of weather to stay as British
subjects or leave and most chose to stay. The French Crown had not done much
for the inhabitants anyway. They had been living under the squabbling French
seigneurs for some time. The British did not leave any presence at Port Royal
and Guillaume Trahan (1611-1682) governed it under syndic. All the French
Acadians wanted was to live in peace, be tranquil and raise their large
families.</span></p>

</span>The Massachusetts Puritans wanted to annex their territory east to
include all of Acadia. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason occupied the
territory between Massachusetts and the Kennebec River, now New Hampshire and
Southwestern Maine. It was poorly governed and settlers from Massachusetts were
moving into the area. Taking control of Acadia would give the Massachusetts
Puritans the territory all the way to the Saint Lawrence and allow them to
benefit from the fish and fur trades. Leverett went to Cromwell to get the
approval of Parliament for the takeover, but Cromwell thought differently. Both
Britain and France were under shaky rule and Cromwell though is might create
bigger problems for either of the two countries if Acadia was annexed to the
Massachusetts Bay Colonies. The Treaty of Westminster was signed in 1656,
whereby both countries agreed they would not aid resurgence of each other’s
country or assist any other enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

to arbitration, but never actually happened. Cromwell handed Acadia over to two
of his countrymen, Thomas Temple and William Crowne, and the Frenchman Charles
La Tour. Again La Tour was back in the thick of things with a barony in Acadia.
However, to get that La Tour had to repay his old debts in Boston, pay for the
expenses at the three garrisons (Port Royal, Saint John and Pentagoet) and
accept Temple and Crowne as partners. The English Lords had no intension of
keeping La Tour as a partner and took advantage of the Frenchman . Temple and
Crowne forced La Tour to sell his share of Acadia to them. Aging, he gave up
with ease and retired to Cape Sable with his wife Jeanne Motin and a daughter,
Marie (1654-). Temple and Crowne then divided the territory east and west.
Temple then leased Crowne’s half from him with financing from Thomas Breedon.
However, Temple lived in Boston and did very little governing of Acadia. While
living at Cape Sable, Charles de Saint-Etienne de La Tour and Jeanne Motin had
four additional children; Jacques (1661-), Charles (1664-), Anne (1664-) and
Marguerite (1665-) before he died in 1666.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

1658 Emmanuel Le Borgne attempted a comeback with his son Alexander Le Borgne
de Belle-Isle at La Have but was quickly disposed of by Temple. Oliver Cromwell
died the same year and by 1660 monarchy returned to Britain. Thomas Temple
thought that his relationship with Breedon would allow him to keep his barony
in Acadia secure. However, the King awarded the territory to a friend of the
court named Thomas Elliott who had little interest in Acadia. Thomas Breedon
then bought Elliott out and became Governor of Acadia himself. This left Temple
without his barony, so he went to London to re-secure his territory. With shrew
maneuvering he was successful and in 1662 he got the governorship back, but was
to cover the debts of Breedon to Elliott. For the next eight years under Thomas
Temple, trade was established between New England and Acadia. The Boston
merchants and Temple made good profits from the trade. It also benefited the
Acadian people, as they were able to get useful goods. Nicholas Denys was left
alone at Saint Peters, Cape Breton where he managed the fish and fur trades. He
was able to pay off his debts, but he finally met defeat when fire destroyed
his post in 1669. Denys then returned to France and wrote the early history of
Acadia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Another war between Britain and Holland started and the French sided
with the Dutch. The Treaty of Breda in 1667 brought the war to an end with
Britain getting back Antigua, Montserrat and half of the island of Saint
Christopher. The Dutch gave up New York and gained Surinam in South America.
Acadia was brought back under French rule. The territory had been under British
rule since 1654 although the people were still mostly French. The feuding
French claimants disappeared under the British government. Thomas Temple had
bettered Acadia as a result of contacts and trade with New England. Hector
d’Andigne Grandfontaine became the Royal Governor of all of Canada and had the
backing of King Louis XIV. Soldiers, men and women were sent to Acadia to
govern and work. The French understanding of the Acadian territory was all of
the land east of the Kennebec River. Canada had grown, but Acadia grew apart
from the rest of Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The inhabitants that populated Acadia in 1671 desired to be “French
Neutrals”. The actual number on the censes did not change a great deal from
that of 1650, but the cultural make up of the inhabitants changed. Many of the
soldiers and their families were sent to France in the mid 1650s. The
inhabitants that remained at that time were mostly settlers and their Acadian
born off springs. Most of the population resided at Port Royal, with small
communities at Pubnico and Pentagoet. The names on the censes taken in 1671
represented the first and second generation of the French Acadian heritage. The
actual population count was 392, represented by 70 heads of families of which
43 heads of families are direct ancestors of the writer and 150 of the
individuals inhabitants can be found in the maternal line of the Legere
genealogy tables. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Although Canada was under a new type of government, seigneuries were
still granted. Vincent Castine who had arrived in Quebec in 1665 at a very
young age went to Pentagoet in 1667 after he was discharge from the military.
He received a grant from the King for land near Fort Pentagoet. At that time
there were a few guns, a number of buildings and a chapel at the fort. He decided to establish a trading post a little
farther up the river from the fort where the town of Castine, Maine now lies.
There he would not be under the watchful eye of the Catholic priest and the
other French settlers. Castine befriended the Indian Chief Madockawando and
married his daughter Mathilde. He ran a very successful fur trading business
becoming quite wealthy from it. A business partner of his was John Nelson, an
Episcopalian and nephew of Sir Thomas Temple. The merchant trading they
conducted was illegal according to both French and British law, but they did it
at will as Acadia was in need of the trade. He had a warehouse in Port Royal
and the Governor encouraged this trade, as it was good for the economy of
Acadia. Castine together with his Indian friends harassed the British in the
Massachusetts colony outposts around Penobscot Bay. Alexander Le Borgne de
Belle Isle, the son of Emmanuel, had been entrenched at Port Royal and got a
new seigneur. His wife was Marie La Tour, the eldest daughter of Charles La
Tour and Jeanne Motin. He controlled the trade and didn’t do much ruling,
however, as he enjoyed the pleasures of life and wine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Acadia was not convenient to either Quebec who was to govern the
territory or to its mother country France. Therefore, little was done for it
and the people survived with their own simple way of life. Trade with New
England kept them financially stable. Pierre Landry was one of the successful
marine merchants of Acadia. The boundaries of Acadia remained to be disputed.
Maine, east of the Kennebec River, had been given to Holland in 1664 when
Britain controlled Acadia. But the French claimed that territory and
Grandfontaine put his headquarters at Fort Pentagoet. Edmond Andres, Governor
of New York built a fort at Pemaquid a few miles west of Penobscot Bay and the
Massachusetts Bay Company had pushed their activities into Southwestern Maine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The French territory of North America was feeble and venerable. Jacques
de Chambly had replaced Grandfontaine at Fort Pentagoet. The Dutch were at war
with Britain and France. Acadia became a colony of Holland after Captain
Jurriaen Aernoutsz and John Rhodes attacked Fort Pentagoet in 1667 and again in
1674, destroying it. They also took control of Saint John, but did not go to
Port Royal. Holland then claimed all of Acadia for William of Orange. New
England was happy to be rid of the bothersome French. However, they didn’t like
the Dutch interfering with the trade they were doing with Acadia. So New
England tried the Dutch as Pirates. Holland compared their conquering of Acadia
to that of Sedgwick in 1654, so the Dutch got away with it. In 1676 Cornelis
Steenwyck was named Governor of the coast and counties of Nova Scotia and
Acadia. Without a military, Acadia still existed as it had for many years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Britain and New England were fighting with the French and the Indians.
The Indians sided with the French because of the ties they had made with the
Catholic Missionaries. The French and Indians also got along because the French
respected the Indian way of life as well as wanting to live peaceable tranquil
lives. The Indian culture was changing due to the British intervention and
aggregation. The taking of their lands, suppression and over hunting added to
the conflict with the Indians. The Treaty of Casco Bay in 1678 ended this war
and the settlers had to pay for the lands they took from the Indians. The
French got back control of Acadia and Hector de Frontenac had become Governor
of Canada. Immigration resumed and people were brought to Acadia from France
and other parts of Canada. Michael Leneuf de La Valliere was named Governor of
Acadia by Frontenac.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Michael Leneuf de La Valliere was originally from Trois-Rivieres, born
in 1640. He went to France for his education and returned to Canada in 1657.
Michael Leneuf was among the explorers in 1661 that attempted to find a passage
from Quebec to Cathay (China) via the Hudson Bay, but turned back because of
disease and fear of the Iroquois Indians. Acadia was not unfamiliar to him as
he had performed duties there for Governor Frontenac and engaged British
merchant ships in illegal trade. While at Saint Peters, Cape Breton in 1665
Michael Leneuf de La Valliere married Marie Deny the only daughter of Nicholas
Denys. He was active in fur trade, fishing and colonizing. It was 1676 when
Michael Leneuf de La Valliere sailed to Chignecto on the his schooner “Saint
Antoine” to assume his gubernatorial duties and renamed the village Beaubassin.
Jean La Barre, Francois Legere and Michael Hache’ Gallant, were three of men
among the settlers that were with La Valliere on board the ship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Legere who was with Michael Leneuf de La Valliere was originally from Angers,
southwest of Paris, France. It is possible that he was related in some way to
Jacques Legere who is the basis of this script. However, he originated from a
different part of France and a study was not pursued. He returned to Quebec,
vanished and left no known descendants. Michael Hache’ Gallant stayed at
Beaubassin and became a very prominent inhabitant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is an ancestor and addressed further in

</span>New England fishermen were using the Acadian shores illegally to dry
their fish catches. Edward Randolph, an agent for the committee of The Lords of
Trade, was engaged to spy on the trade activities of Acadia. A compromise made
in Quebec by John Nelson, Castine’s business partner, allowed the licensing of
New Englanders to use the shores and La Valliere made Nelson his agent to sell
the licenses in Boston. Paris was not happy with this situation. Frontenac had
lost his support of the French Crown and Francois-Marie Perrot replaced La
Valliere in 1684. Perrot had been in Montreal under Frontenac and once Perrot
was in Acadia he continued to allow the illegal trading with New England.
Therefore, the fisheries trade continued without French control. France and
Britain had trouble solving the boundaries, fishing and trading rights in the
New World and tried to solve it with the Treaty of White Hall. It had some
success by keeping the two countries from war over North America, but it was
short lived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The powers of Europe remained in turmoil with a revolution going on in
Britain. William of Orange rallied the protestant states, drove King James, II
to France and William became King of Britain in 1689. King James, II attempted
a comeback, but was badly defeated in Scotland and Ireland. With the strong
combine protestant powers in Europe, New England felt it was time to drive the
Catholic demons, the French, from Acadia. The French and Indians had been
causing havoc for the Puritans among the New England colonies, even though
their numbers were considerably less than those of the New Englanders. Andres’s
fort at Pemaquid was demolished. Schenectady, New York, Dover and Salmon Falls
in New Hampshire were devastated and Falmouth (now Portland, Maine) was sacked
and burned. In 1688 the total population of Acadia was 881 people including 28
soldiers. The center of Acadian population was Port Royal where there was also
a small fort. The census of 1689 reviled 461 people in Port Royal, 78 in
Chignecto and 164 at the Minus Basin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Louis-Alexander des Friches de Meneval was then Governor of Acadia.
France and King Louis, XIV had a large army in Europe, but did not send many
soldiers to the colonies. De Meneval was rebuilding the fort at Port Royal and
the number of his soldiers grew to 86. This French colony was very venerable
and the Puritans took advantage of it. In 1690 Sir William Phips was sent to
take Acadia with more soldiers than there were inhabitants and soldiers in
Acadia. Meneval’s meager army and inadequate fort was no match to the large
number of invading forces from New England. Meneval had no choice but to
surrender and was taken prisoner. Phips men then rifled the church, cut down
the cross, pulled down the high alter, broke the Catholic images, pillaged and
robed the town.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Phips then made the inhabitants of Port Royal sign allegiance to William
and Mary, the British crowns. This first allegiance of the many that would come
in future years. However, Phips did allow the inhabitants to continue the
practice of their Catholic religious believes. The inhabitants, including those
from the Minas Basin settlements, thought that if they signed the allegiance
without resistance, Phips would leave them alone and this he did. He then appointed
a council to govern the colony. Chevalier, a French officer at Port Royal, was
made president of this council. Other men of the council were Alexander Le
Borgne de Belle-Isle, Pierre Du Breuil, Mathieu de Goutin, Rene Landry and
Daniel La Blanc. In Boston, Phips was considered a military hero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Joseph Robineau de Villebon, an officer for de Meneval, was in France
when Phips took Port Royal. Upon his return to Acadia in the later part of
1690, he was made the French Governor of Acadia, but he allowed Chevalier to
keep his position at Port Royal, He was under British rule, but a French
officer. Because of the success Phips had in the taking of Port Royal, Phips
was sent by the Boston Puritans to conquer Quebec. There Phips was badly
defeated under the guns of the fortress and aided by Villebon at Cape
Tourmente. Phips returned to Boston without plunder and the colony issued paper
money to pay the expenses of the failed siege. Villebon then directed the
French and Indian hit and run attacks on the Bay Colonies from Fort Naschouac
on the Saint John River near Fredericton, New Brunswick. A soldier posted at
Fort Naschouac was Jacques Legere dit La Rosette, a drummer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The governing at Port Royal by the Puritans was given to a landholder
from Maine named Edward Tyng. When he arrived at Port Royal with the
businessman John Nelson, the people of Port Royal told him that the Indians
would assault him and they would step back and watch. Tyng decided that Port
Royal was not for him and he would govern from Boston as Temple had. On the
voyage back to Boston with Nelson, they were captured by French sailors and
imprisoned. Tyng was sent to France, where he died and Nelson was jailed in
Quebec.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Phips, who was now the new royal governor of Massachusetts, sent a
representative to Port Royal and found the Acadian attitude unchanged. He was
besieged with other problems and left the governing status quo. Thus ending
Puritan governing in Acadia. Villebon continued his campaign with the Indians
against the New England colonies, destroying the villages of York and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wells, Maine and Durham, New Hampshire.
Control was changing back to France when Villebon took Fort Pemaquid.
Massachusetts retaliated by sending Colonel Benjamin Church to the defenseless
Beaubassin village and slaughtered all the live stock and burned the buildings.
When Church was returning to Boston he considered attacking Fort Naschouac, but
sailed on toward Boston. He later received orders to go back and root Villebon
from Fort Naschouac. The fort was well defended by Villebon and a day and night
later Church was forced to retreat down the river in defeat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The war between France and Britain in Europe
ended and the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697, again restoring Acadia back
to France. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Disputes over fishing rights, trade and borders did not go away.
Massachusetts still claimed a large part of Acadia and wanted to control the
French territory. Villebon confronted Boston regarding their illegal
activities, but the inhabitants of Acadia really did not care. There were some
things that the inhabitants needed or wanted, such as fancy textiles, arms,
sophisticated tools and better farm implements. They should have been able to
get these from France, but they had to trade with New England for such products
while the authorities looked the other way. They just wanted to be left alone,
live their simple lives, raising large families and getting by with what was
needed. The early French Acadian people were not overly industrious; their
method of farming and fishing with weirs required little physical labor. The
inhabitants live simple lives, but well. They made do with what was available.
Luxuries and good sprits were few and far between among the inhabitants. They
produce a palatable beer made of branches from fir and spruce trees and boiled
molasses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The center of the Acadian culture was still at Port Royal where most of
the inhabitants resided. With this small number of inhabitants, many were
related to each other and it was difficult to find a partner that was not a
cousin. New settlements were founded. Jacques Bourgeois, II, had established
Chignecto, renamed Beaubassin, in 1676. Other Port Royal leaders Pierre
Melanson, Pierre Theriault and Jacques Le Blanc, with three of his brothers,
settled Grand Pre in 1682. This is the town Henry Wardsworth Longfellow wrote
of in his epic poem “Evangeline“. Mathieu Martin, the first born Acadian,
settled Cobequid on the Minas Basin in 1689 and he became the seigneur. This
town is now known as Toro, Nova Scotia. Pisiquid another Minus Basin community,
now Windsor, was also prospering. Pierre Thibodeau, Guillaume Blanchard and a
few families had crossed the Bay of Fundy and settled the new communities of
Chipoudy and Blanchard on the banks of the Peticoudiak River in New Brunswick.
Philippe Mius d’Entremont had the only true seigneurie situated at Cape Sables.
The censes of 1693 recorded a population of inhabitants in Port Royal at 307
among 55 families and Beaubassin 127 inhabitants. By 1700 the population in
Acadia had increased to 1500 people. Soldiers that did come were encouraged to
stay in Acadia, but the population increased for the most part came from
within.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Villebon had died and Jacques-Francois de Brouillan assumed the governorship
of Acadia in 1701. In his opinion, he found the governing structure in
shambles. The Acadians existed with little governing as they were far removed
from both the mother country and Quebec. Mathieu de Goutin had been made the
King’s counselor and Lieutenant General, chief clerk and judge. He was married
to Jeanne Thibodeau, a daughter of Pierre Thibodeau and Jeanne Theriault.
Subsequently Mathieu de Goutin was related in some way to many of the
inhabitants of the settlements and they were reluctant to appear before him for
any litigation. The smaller villages were governed under the guidance of panels
made up from the inhabitants with the priest usually having the final decision.

</span>The crowns of Europe were engrossed with the fight over who would
acquire the throne of Spain during Queen Anne‘s War. Joseph Dudley, who the
Puritans had previously sent back to England, returned to New England to Govern
in 1702. He first attempted to make peace with the Indians, but it did not
last, as the Indians did not like the British. The Indians raided Deerfield,
Connecticut burning barns and homes, killing 50 settlers and drove most of
those that survived the raid to Canada. Dudley blamed the Acadians and
retaliated by sending Colonel Benjamin Church again to the unprotected
communities in the Minus Basin and Beaubassin. There they broke down the dams,
burned homes, barns and crops. Port Royal was spared and Dudley alleged he did
not attack Port Royal because he was awaiting orders from England. The puritans
claimed he avoided Port Royal because he was lining his own pockets with the
illegal trade. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Dudley’s friend Samuel Vetch had just returned from failed duties in
South America and Dudley sent him to Quebec to negotiate a prisoner exchange
and promote trade. The New England colonists believed that Vetch and his
associates were trading in violation of law. They were tried and convicted of
trading with the enemy by the General Court, but it was overturned by the
Queen’s attorney general. Still the Puritans were convinced that Dudley was
behind the scheme. Dudley had to prove that he was not a friend to Acadia and
France, so he put together a militia of untrained and unprepared men. Under the
leadership of Colonel John March, they were directed to seize Port Royal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1706 Daniel d’Auger Subercase, an experienced French officer, was sent to
govern Acadia. Finding Port Royal in a sad state of affairs, he quickly
repaired the fort and trained forces made up from French soldiers, Indian
warriors and Acadian militiamen. Colonel March’s army of over 1000 men arrived
in Port Royal Basin in early June of 1707. He positioned his troops on both
sides of the basin about 5 miles from the fort and commenced movement toward
the fort so to put a squeeze on the fort. As they moved toward the fort the
Acadian defenses retreated into the fort. Heavy bombardment from the fort broke
down the New England militia and they retreated to Casco Bay. When Colonel
March’s officer arrived in Boston to report their failure, they were publicly
shamed. Dudley responded by sending Colonel Francis Wainwright with
reinforcements to Casco Bay and join Colonel March’s remaining troops for
another attempt to take Port Royal. Subercase knowing they would return was
ready for the invaders and again successfully defended Port Royal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this same period of time there was also a small group of French soldiers and
their families at Pentagoet with the younger Castine. One of the soldiers was
Nicholas Babineau. He had arrived in Acadia in 1670 and was not married until
1687 in Port Royal. His wife was Marguerite Granger (1668-1719) the daughter of
Laurent Granger (1637-), an Englishman, and Marie Landry (1646-). Nicholas
Babineau and Marguerite Granger had six children and while posted at Pentagoet
his wife gave birth to their youngest child, Jean Pierre Babineau (1709-1796).
Years later, 1733, Jean Pierre Babineau married Isabelle Breau at Grand Pre and
settled there. He and his family moved three years latter and founded the
village of Terre-Rouge at Le Coude. Today this is the city of Moncton, New
Brunswick where there is a monument honoring them in Mascaret Park. Jean Pierre
Babineau and Isabelle Breau were victims of the suffering and deportation in
1755. They are ancestors of the writer on the maternal side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Queen Ann’s war was winding down and the crowns were engrossed
positioning for power in Europe. Little attention was being made to North
America and France was unable to give support to Acadia. Subercase was recognized
for his defense at Port Royal, but France advised that finances were not
available. He would have to find the finances they believed to be hoarded by
the Acadians to pay his bills. His soldiers were becoming unhappy and the
militiamen returned to their farms. Things really didn’t change much in Acadia.
Neutrality was what the Acadians professed. It was under French rule, but the
mother country didn’t do much for the colony. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Samuel Vetch came up with a plan to conquer Acadia and all of Canada. He
had a lot of political connections in England and his friend John Dudley, was
the Governor of Massachusetts. Vetch got the approval of the Queen for an
invasion, a commission as a colonel and the promise of becoming the Governor of
Canada. Colonel Francis Nicholson, a highly experienced administrator in many
of the American colonies supported Vetch’s plan as well and would become the
commander-in-chief. In 1709 the orders were issued to assemble the invading
forces. Nicholson would command an army invading from the west moving into the
Saint Lawrence Valley. Vetch was to sail with the main invading forces with the
British regulars that were due from England. The British troops were instead
sent to Portugal thereby delaying the planed invasion. Getting late in the year
the decision was made to delay the invasion until the following year and limit
it to Acadia only. This gave the men enlisted additional time to be better
trained and Nicholson was sent to London to get approval of the delay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

commander in chief. With the royal marines, 1,500 trained colonist from the
American colonies, six royal navy warships, one Massachusetts warship and 30
plus transports, the invading forces set sail for the Bay of Fundy at the end
of September. They arrived at Port Royal Basin having lost one transport by
grounding in the Digby Gut and loosing 26 men from drowning. Subercase knew his
days were numbered when he saw the size of the attacking forces. His troops and
defenses were insufficient, but he had to put up some resistance for his honor.

The inhabitants within a cannon shot of the fort would be allowed to stay on
their land with their personal belongings, crops and livestock. The distance
was established to be a three miles radius and it was determined the number of

</span>These terms were reasonable to bring all of Acadia under British
control. When the documents were signed, Vetch and Nicholson wrote to the Queen
and advised her that the British Empire in America included all of Acadia and
Nova Scotia from the Saint Croix River to the Cape Gaspe’. On October 16, 1710
the French soldiers marched from the fort and the British and American troops
marched in. The French flag was lowered and the Union Jack raised. They then
drank to Queen Ann and renamed the town Annapolis Royal. The garrison and their
families, totaling 258 people, were boarded on to the ships and sent honorably
to France. Nicholson returned to Boston in late October and Vetch was left at
Annapolis Royal to command 200 Royal Marines, a 250-member New England militia
and govern Acadia.

</span>Acadian population had increased to nearly 2000 people by 1710. They
were well settled, scattered, independent and also stubborn. The French Acadian
people were very strong Roman Catholics and had large families. The culture,
society, ideals, mentality, aspirations, way of life, values, priorities and
morals were set and controlled by the priest or pastor of the church. They
cohered favorable with the Indians. Under British control again didn’t really
mean much to the inhabitants. Vetch recommended in 1710 and again in 1711 that
the French inhabitants be expelled. London didn’t want to take the
responsibility. Had they been expelled there would be no subjects to govern or
tax, leaving the colony without people. It would also be more difficult to
handle the Indians without the French still present. Paul Mascarene was born in
France, but a Huguenot and a career British Army Captain. He was appointed to
command the guard, build relations with the inhabitants and do the unpleasant
duties for Vetch, enforcing the regulations and collecting the taxes. Mascarene
appointed eight deputies to deal with the people for Vetch’s benevolence in
1710. Among them were; Pierre Melanson at Grand Pre and Mathieu Martin in<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cobequid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Under the rule of Britain, the Acadians believed it again was temporary.
The military governing purported to bind the Indians and Acadians. Trade with
France and Canada was prohibited allowing only trade among themselves at
Annapolis Royal. They were promised they would be treated well if they lived
civilly and peaceable. However, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, at that time the
Governor of New France was told the Acadians would suffer “Military Execution”
if they did not prevent the Indian raids on the New England and New York
colonies. Frenchmen and Indians inhabited the land under British rule and the
inhabitants did as they always had, living a tranquil life and raising large
families. The Micmacs knew under the new rule they would have to fight the
British to maintain their way of life. The British had taken some of their land,
did not respect their Indian customs and did not like the religion they shared
with the French. They were also jealous of the French relationship with the
native North Americans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Vetch’s soldiers were becoming dissatisfied, as London was not supporting
Vetch in Acadia. It was realized that the Acadians didn’t have the wealth as
thought, they had little to nothing. The inhabitants were not able to pay their
stipend and Boston merchants were coming up short because of non-payments for
goods. Vetch’s colony was falling apart. The inhabitants were resistant to
work. Mascarene attempted to roust the people from the Minas Basin and failed.
With the blessing of Vaudreuil, Bernard-Anselme de Castine, son of Jean-Vincent
de Castine, with his Indian relatives and friends had more success with his hit
and run attracts on the British settlements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Europe the war was still on between France and Britain. Nicholson promoted a
scheme for Britain to invade Canada by taking Vaudreuil at Quebec and bring all
of Canada and Acadia under British rule. Vetch was recalled from Annapolis
Royal and sent to join Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker and General Jack Hill to
attack Quebec via the Saint Lawrence with 50 ships and 10,000 men. Nicholson
would proceed from the west via Lake Champlain. Poor navigational skills and
untrained seaman caused a loss of 10 ships and thousands of sailors and
soldiers when attempting to navigate the approaches of the Saint Lawrence. The
invasion was botched. However, it did bring relief to the garrison at Annapolis
Royal. Jack Hill’s soldiers that survived the Saint Lawrence were sent to man
the fort at Annapolis Royal. After they arrived, they proclaimed to be well
suited to defend Acadia from French Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Tories replaced Vetch and appointed Francis Nicholson Governor of
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in 1712. In 1714 the Treaty of Rastadt concluded
among other agreements that Britain would get the Hudson Bay territory, pieces
of Newfoundland and a greater part of Acadia within it’s ancient boundaries,
but the boundaries were not defined. The French would keep Cape Breton Island,
the Isle of Saint Jean and the Saint Lawrence River Valley. The French
inhabitants would be allowed to live on British soil of the Nova Scotia peninsular,
the Chignecto isthmus and the main land, New Brunswick. To the French, Acadia
had always included land southwest to the Kennebec, northwest to the Saint
Lawrence and all of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island. The French now realized
that Britain’s Acadia included the main land as well. The language of the
treaty allowed the French inhabitants to stay if they wished, keep their farms
or sell them and leave. They were also allowed to practice their Catholic
religion, contrary to British laws. However, they would be subjects of the king
of England.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The British wanted the French inhabitants to leave, but they were in no
hurry, therefore the inhabitants procrastinated for years. France, at the same
time wanted their subject to leave the British territories and move to the
French territory of Cape Breton Island and start new lives. Renamed Isle Royal,
it was to be governed by Philippe Costabelle. He brought about 150 French
people from Newfoundland, Canada and France to Havre’ an l’Anglois. It was renamed
Louisburg and Costabelle expected the French people from Acadia to join the
settlement. They did not want to give up their easy method of farming the land
they had developed and go to the forested and rocky land of the island. Among
the men he brought from France was Mathieu de Goutin, the judge who had been
deported to France in 1710. De Goutin, you may recall, was married to Jeanne
Thibaudeau the daughter of Pierre who had fathered 16 children at Port Royal.
Costabelle sent an officer to Annapolis Royal, Grand Pre and Cobequid to rally
the heads of the families. “They were Frenchmen who would do as told”. Not so!
They swore allegiance and agreed to go, but stayed, the typical Acadian way,
they did, as they wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the French left Acadia, the settlements would have been rendered to a primitive
state. Therefore, they were encouraged to stay by British officials and granted
their fidelity by giving oaths of allegiance. They had their choice of either
crown. Stay, swear to obey a protestant king or move to the French territory of
his own country. Britain did not force the issue so they stayed. At any rate,
the oaths would not mean too much to the Acadians because they had been
obtained on numerous occasions in the past and it just became a way of pacifying
the ruling reign at the time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1715 Thomas Caulfeild was Lieutenant Governor and again attempted to have the
French subjects swear allegiance. It failed and he turned to London for advice,
however, none came. Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch were at odds with each
other and their respective political parties. It was them that organized the
governing state that existed under Dudley’s plan and they would have to be the
people to solve the dilemma. Nicholson was gone from Acadia and finished his
career off as Governor of South Carolina from 1720 to 1725.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vetch had won over the governorship of Acadia
and held it until 1717, however he never returned to Annapolis Royal. Colonel
Richard Philipps a career soldier was rewarded the Governorship of Newfoundland
and Nova Scotia. He gave up Newfoundland in 1727 and kept Nova Scotia through
1749. Philipps governed in abstention through junior officers while staying in
London. Captain John Doucett relieved Caulfeild as Lieutenant Governor in 1717
and was charged to do something about the lax administration. As in the past,
he came up against the stubborn French Acadians and they found more ways to
delay the signing of allegiance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1720 the Board of Trade sent Philipps to Acadia in person to organize a
government modeled after Virginia’s. This was doomed at its beginning as the
subjects were Catholic and under British law they were unable to vote or hold
office. His attempts were friendly rather that forceful, but it still failed.
He could not expel them, as he didn’t have the soldiers so he returned to
London. The inhabitants did not want to bear arms against their native country
France or the Indians. They wished to remain neutral. London and the Board did
not do much to help the colony. Thomas Coran wanted to bring war veterans,
Baltic and Swiss Protestants to integrate the people but didn’t get the
official backing or financial resources to do so. Life in Acadia went on as
always, British governing with no government administration or control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The French began to make the best of the Acadian lands, which they kept
in the treaty of Utrecht. These lands included Cape Breton Island (Isle Royal)
and Isle Saint Jean (Prince Edward Island). A fort was built at Louisburg and
the city grew into a colonial metropolis with outpost and its population
increasing to over 3,000 inhabitants by 1726. The Isle Saint Jean became more
important to the colonist than its wilderness of 1720.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Having got a foothold in Louisburg, the French began to flex a little
muscle and redefined the boundaries of Acadia. As in the past, its boundaries
were always disputed. Now the French were claiming that only Annapolis Royal
and south to Yarmouth on the peninsula of Nova Scotia was all that Britain was
entitled to in the Treaty of Utrecht. They told the French people at Beaubassin
and the Minus settlements of this and told the Indians of Maine and the Saint
John Valley that New England had no rights on those lands or the lands in New
Brunswick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the custom of Indian culture, they moved about their land frequently, not
settling in one community as the Europeans did. This was interpreted by New
England that the Indians did not have title to any of the land. New England
claimed that all of Maine and New Hampshire belonged to them according to the
Treaty of Utrecht. The Indians agreed with the French that the New Englanders
were intruders and taking their land. Therefore, they retaliated with raids,
barn burning and scattering or killing of livestock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt;text-align:justify;mso-pagination:

Governor Samuel Shute, members of his council, notables from Massachusetts and
New Hampshire and the Abenakis Sagamores was held at Arrowsic Island. This “Paw
Wow” was to settle the issue of the Indians obeying British law and governing
on British land. But Chief Wiwurna didn’t consider all of Maine British land
and claimed all the lands east of the Kennebec River. The negotiations broke
down and the Indian Chiefs left. That night the Indian councils meet and went before
the British the following morning. Facing reprisal from New England, they
agreed to ratify the Treaty of Portsmouth, a very loosely worded treaty to
benefit the British.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Vaudreuil was committed to provide supplies and support to the Indians so
they could protect their lands in Maine and Acadia. The Jesuit priest Sebastien
Rale represented Vaudreuil and was his spokesman to the Indians. Rale
repudiated the treaty at Arrowsic, declared that the treaty was null and void.
He drew the line at the Kennebec and warned New England against crossing it.
Shute sent raiders to Norridgewock, Rale’s mission, to silence him. Rale
escaped, but the raiders found papers that confirmed what Shute had expected.
That the French were behind the Indian resistance. In 1722 the Indians
retaliated, attacking settlements along the Kennebec and Shute declared war.
For a couple years, war went on with Lieutenant Governor William Dummer in
command. At this same time the Maliseets of the Saint John Valley and the
Micmacs of Nova Scotia fought the New Englanders over land occupancy, fishing
rights and allegiance. The end of Rale’s war came in 1725 when New England
militiamen raided Norridgewock in a massacre and killed Rale. Peace was finally
restored when the Abenakis of Maine, the Maliseets of the Saint John Valley and
the Micmacs of Nova Scotia submitted to British rule under the Treaty of
Boston. The French or Vaudreuil were not happy with this outcome.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Peace was at hand and the British could work this out with the Indians.
However, the Acadians were still tied to France with their language and
religion. French culture was nearby in Lewisburg and that influenced the people
at Grand Pre, Pisiquid, Cobequid and Beaubassin, where the bulk of Acadians
lived. While the Isle of Royal was developing, the Isle of Saint-Jean was also
growing. New French settlers were brought to Isle Saint Jean and by 1735 its
population had grown to 432.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The settlers expanded their farms and grew crops for trade between the
Isle of Royal, and the communities of the Minus Basin, the Isthmus of
Chignecto, and Isle Saint Jean. The ties with France became stronger even
though Britain governed the settlements. The British presence<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>existed only at Annapolis and Canso.
Business as usual, Britain governing without direction control or force. So the
French settlers remained the neutrals they desired without having to bear arms
against anyone. They swore allegiance to Britain in verse only and lived their
simple tranquil lives. The trade between New England and Nova Scotia British
settlements grew apart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Thomas Pelham-Holles, Duke of New Castile and Sir Robert Walpole were
the Lords of Nova Scotia. Their administration was negligible and corrupt while
Lt. Col. Lawrence Armstrong was governing the colony. As Phillips and Doucett
had attempted in the past, so did Armstrong make his attempts to obtain the
oaths of allegiance. He was not concerned with the settlers not bearing arms.
It was in violation of British law for Catholics to bear arms along with other
restrictions on the Catholics, such as voting, performing official duties or
practicing their religion. As other governors, he had his problems with the
stubborn Acadians and in a disagreement, he banished a Catholic priest, Father
Breslay, from Annapolis Royal. The men of Annapolis Royal did cooperate with
Armstrong. However, those at the Minus Basin and Isthmus of Chignecto refused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The following spring the Acadian men of Annapolis Royal rescinded their
oaths. However, a British Ensign named Robert Wroth was able to obtain a
loosely worded pledge of allegiance from the other Acadian settlement and the
British lifted an embargo they had placed on trade. Phillips was recalled from
his retirement in London to return to Acadia in 1729 and straighten out the
allegiance to the British king. The Acadians got what they wanted and the
British pretended their issues were satisfied. Accommodations were made,
promises won, loyalty and neutrality solved. Phillips returned to London in 1730
and left Armstrong to govern ungovernable people in a growing settlement with
its people rapidly multiplying from within. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The Acadia population was growing fast. By 1736 there were 4,000 to
5,000 inhabitants, double that of 1710. The plentiful marshland available to
farm gave the young incentive and ample opportunity to raise families. The were
295 couples married at Annapolis Royal between 1702 and 1730 and they produced
an average of 6.75 children. Famines, epidemics, wars or hard work did not
effect them. The culture fostered longevity. There were evils however, as
immigration had ended in 1710. Very few of the women found husbands among the
British soldiers and the young had to look hard to find a spouse who was not a
second or third cousin. It became common for the priest to give dispensation
for consanguinity, permission to marry first cousins. The colony was becoming
inbred. The few outsiders that did come to the communities were either British
or New Englanders and the French speaking Acadians had nothing to do with them.
What little outside influence that did arrive was from the French priest or
travelers from the French community of Louisburg. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Nova Scotia belonged to King George. The people could not continue to be
“French Neutrals”. Ineffective and unimpressive rule would not disappear. The
agreement made by Philipps would not last long and change was being made, but
the settlers would not accept it. Some Acadians lived near Annapolis Royal, but
most of them were away from British influence or authority residing at the
Minus Basin and the Isthmus of Chignecto. The trade with the Isle of Royal and
influence of Louisburg irritated the British. The only community the British
actually controlled, other than Port Royal, was Canso with its fisheries and
fish trade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>New Englanders fished the waters of the Grand Banks off the shores of
Nova Scotia and brought their catch ashore for processing. Trade with Europe
and New England flourished, as did the fishing industry. The vessels used in
this trade were called “Sack ships”. Dry wine called “Sec”, in the French
language, was imported on these ships on the return voyage and this is where
the name originated. Liquor was the primary westward trade and Canso had many
taverns that were patronized by the New England fishermen while in port. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Nova Scotia needed the backing of the British Government to solve the
problems in the colony and it was not getting it. The colony remained an
outpost populated by a handful of soldiers, gangs of seasonal fishermen, bands
of hostile Indians and the stubborn French Neutrals. Phillips had good plans
for development, but Walpole and Newcastle procrastinated. Adventurers could
more easily find their way to the American colonies without any government
backing and therefore, Nova Scotia suffered for it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>David Dunbar was sent to Nova Scotia to survey and draw plans for a new
colony. However, he was more ambitious and joined up with Thomas Coran to build
and promote a colony at Pemaquid on the Maine coast. With the backing of the
British Board of Trade, he rebuilt the fort, laid out streets and began
constructing houses and retail buildings. This attracted 100 new inhabitants
and they formed a new province called Georgia. The Board of Trade had second
thoughts about this arrangement and decided it should be a county in Nova
Scotia under Phillips’ governorship, leaving Dunbar without any title. New
England was displeased with this new settlement becoming a part of Nova Scotia
and challenged the decision in court. The London court found that the land
between the Kennebec and the Saint Croix Rivers belonged to Massachusetts, not
Nova Scotia. This would remain that way until the Missouri Compromise in 1820
when Maine became a separate state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Between 1730 and 1732 there were four attempts to improve the
settlement. Thomas Coran wanted to bring protestant settlers from Europe’s
Rhine Valley and got the support from the Board of Trade. The idea was good,
but they didn’t get the financial aid needed to make it work. Boston’s Huguenot
Church had a plan to bring French speaking protestant refugees from Britain,
but this failed because there was no legislative assembly to issue currency
bills. Another “pig in a poke” failed when Samuel Waldo from Maine bought the
rights of Nova Scotia from John Nelson. Planning to bring Protestants from the
Baltic's and Scotland, his scheme failed when no one took him seriously.
Lawrence Armstrong thinking Paul Mascarene had influence, sent him<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to New England to recruit settlers. This also
failed, as New Englanders did not want military rule, which was how Nova Scotia
was governed at that time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Agathe de Saint-Etienne de La Tour, (also known as Mrs. Campbell) the
granddaughter of Charles La Tour and Jeanne Motin went to London in 1733 and
convinced the Board of Trade that she held the sole seigniorial rights of
inhabited Nova Scotia and the inhabitants (tenants) beloved her. The board paid
her off and all rights lodged with King George II. Armstrong attempted to build
a barracks at Grand Pre, but was turned back by the Indians claiming that
British land only included Annapolis Royal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The Government of Nova Scotia had almost no income, as there was little
to tax. The only revenue collected was that from the fishing trade. There were
no new settlers arriving and therefore they were no new taxable landowners.
Smuggling was the most productive trade and that avoided taxation. The lack of
taxes and revenue created a no win situation for Armstrong. For without the
monies, he could not build his government or forces. Therefore, he existed with
little power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Inhabitants were appointed councilors and attempted to do some
governing, mostly by French law. The French Neutrals continued to live and
govern with their deputies, publish decrees, kept order and made representation
to the British Crown. They live under this method because British law
restricted the inhabitants of their religious practices. The priest played a
major roll in the governing of the Acadians as well as their way of life. This
vexed the British rulers at Annapolis Royal. Life continued, Acadians living on
British land, living their simple life, farming the marshland with little
effort and allowing the forest to flourish. Labor was not a<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>priority of their lives. To the British
rulers, the Acadians were stubborn, headstrong, obstinate, conceited, proud,
lazy and intractable. But they were happy with their religion and large
families in this out of the way peaceable corner of the earth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Issac Louis de Forant, a new governor of the French colonies arrived at
Louisburg on the Isle Royal in 1730 to find a booming city with sophistication,
commerce, and military strength. The city resembled those of France. The
population of Louisburg was more than 2,000 people, with smaller communities up
and down the coast, totaling another 2,500 people. The Isle of Saint Jean had a
population of about 600 with both Acadian farmers and French settlers. France’s
North American colonies finally flourished with Louisburg as its center of
culture. History and the future of Canada would have been considerably
different if the French had supported the colonization 50 years earlier. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Fishing was the major commerce on the Isle Royal, but trade with other
French colonies in Acadia and the military played an important role in the
livelihood of it’s inhabitants. Farming was not a priority for the Frenchmen of
Lewisburg and it eventually was a downfall for the community and it’s environs.
The supplies of wheat and produce from trade were insufficient to sustain
appropriate diets. As grander as Louisburg and its fortification was, it was
destined to come to its demise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Forant died a few years after his arrival and was replaced by
Jean-Baptiste-Louise Le Prevost Duquesnel. However, Francois Bigot was the
military commander and colonial administrator for Forant and became powerful
and successful. No one wanted to oppose Bigot even though he was notably
corrupt, and eventually imprisoned. Duquesnel presided over the colonies of
it’s elite, the well to do families, the artisans, the business people and the
poor. The Recollet friars maintained the judicial system, Brothers of Charity
operated the hospitals and Sisters of the Congregation ran the schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Bread and staples often were scarce, but wine and brandy was always
plentiful and eventually became the enemy. Crime increased and the garrison
became police officers rather than soldiers. Discontentment overcame the
soldiers from the lack of provisions, adequate quarters and working as
Louisburg’s labor pool. The officers promised to make change, however, they lived
the high life and were the aristocrats of Louisburg. Business interest and
trade kept them well off. Two of these officers had roots in French Acadia
which had existed for generations. They were brothers, Louis Du Pont Duchambon
and Francois Du Pont Duvivier. Originally solders at Port Royal they had
married while there and were banished in 1710. Duchambon’s wife was the
granddaughter of Philippe Mius d'Entremont and Duvivier was married to a
d’Entremont and granddaughter of Charles La Tour and Jeanne Motin. Duchambon
rose to become second in the military command and Duvivier’s son Francois
became one of the wealthiest traders at Louisburg.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Peace had existed for some time, thanks to Robert Walpole. However,
European parliaments and kingdoms began falling apart. Political positioning,
conflict and war prevailed. In America, it was called King George’s war and
fought in the Caribbean and Acadia. Governor Duquesnel appointed Duvivier, a
merchant soldier, to command his soldiers and strike Canso. This was
accomplished with little resistance in May 1744. The garrison and New England
fishermen there were captured and imprisoned at Lewisburg. The lack of
provisions at Louisburg caused Duquesnel to negotiate the exchange of prisoners
for a few Frenchmen held at Boston. A condition of the exchange was that the
soldiers would not bear arms for one year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

son of Agathe de La Tour and her British Lieutenant husband were among the
prisoners in Louisburg. He had been baptized Jean-Baptiste, but anglicized his
mane to John Bradstreet. A great grandson of Charles La Tour as was Duquesnel;
Bradstreet in later years advanced to become a Major General in the British
army and had a brilliant career. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>After the success of Canso, Duvivier moved down the Nova Scotia
peninsula to free his countrymen from British rule at Annapolis Royal. Landing
at Baie Verte he found the French inhabitants to be uncooperative and wanting
again to remain neutral. A few Frenchmen joined with him and he convinced the
Indians to join him to drive the British into the sea. He proceeded from Grand
Pre expecting little resistance at Annapolis Royal with back up of a naval
blockade. When Duvivier arrived he found the British well prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul Mascarene, Lieutenant General, President
of the Council and a Lieutenant Colonel of Philips regiment was in command at
Port Royal. Mascarene had successfully defended the fort, aided by
reinforcements that arrived from Boston. Earlier in the summer an attack by
Indians and Jean Louis Le Loutre, the missionary turned warrior, had caused
Mascarene to get the help from New England. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The ships for the planned naval blockade never left Louisburg. The
French and Indians were inadequately prepared for a successful battle. Again
reinforcements from Boston bolstered the British defense and Mascarene stood
fast to defeat the invading French. An officer, named de Gannes, from Louisburg
went to Port Royal and advised Duvivier that the ships for the blockade would
not be coming as they were being sent to protect the shipping lanes from
privateers. The invasion was abandon. Duvivier returned to Louisburg, then
sailed to France to plan a larger campaign for the following year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>De Gannes took command and tried to persuade
the French Acadians to join him and his soldiers, but they resisted and
remained neutral. Mascarene knew who had sided with the French and he was very
persuasive with the French inhabitants to maintain their neutrality and oaths
of allegiance. They were satisfied to live under a mild and tranquil Government
and not be required to take up arms. De Gannes returned to Louisburg with his
men in October 1744. Mascarene believed the allegiance of the Acadian
inhabitants was earnest and they got along well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts was convinced that Acadia
would play an important roll in the colonization of North America and therefore
was giving it some attention. That is something that had not previously
happened in Acadia. Shirley was successful in persuading London to support his
beliefs. The borders of New England and Massachusetts were uncomfortably close
to the French and Naval strength at Louisburg. Governor Shirley felt that Cape
Breton should be conquered. John Bradstreet had the plan and William Vaughn, a
merchant/soldier from Damariscotta, Maine, endorsed it as well. Shirley
consulted his general council, but was delayed in getting their support.
Shirley then recruited and equipped an army. Recruiting was easy with the
promise of plunder from the mansions at Louisburg. There existed a bias passion
between New Englanders and the French Catholics. The recruits could vision them
destroying the churches and religious idols of French Acadia. Samuel Moody, a
76 year old New England Chaplin armed himself with an ax to smash the idols. As
war fever grew, so did the prayers of New Englanders. Benjamin Franklin advised
his brothers of Massachusetts that work and action would do better than
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>William Pepperrell, another Maine merchant, was the chosen general of
the forces and Samuel Waldo appointed brigadier. John Bradstreet the
professional military man was made Lieutenant Colonel of the Massachusetts
regiments and Edward Tyng, son of the ill fated governor of the Puritans,
became commodore of the naval forces that were put together from New England.
The invasion was on and Commodore Peter Warren of the Royal British Naval was
brought back from the Caribbean to assist in the naval blockade. The New
England invaders were 4,250 strong. Weather and ice slowed them, but on May 10,
1745, they made their first move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The defenders were 560 French and Swiss soldiers and 900 militiamen from
Louisburg and environs. Duchambon, the French Commander awaited the naval
support from France which he had requested by sending Francois Du Pont Duvivier
to France. Seeing the ships on the horizon, he though at first they were the
French naval forces. Soon he realized Louisburg was under attack and thereafter
fought off various charges from sea and landings outside of Louisburg. Marin, a
French Lieutenant had left Quebec in January with 600 soldiers and Indians to
aid Duchambon on his planned campaign in Nova Scotia. After capturing two
schooners carrying supplies to Paul Mascarene they pulled back and met resistance
at Tatmagouche Bay from Tyng’s Squadron. Naval support from France finally
arrived at Louisburg, but was defeated effectively by the Royal British Navy.
After 7 weeks of defending the attacks and bombardments, Duchambon was beaten
and surrendered Louisburg.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Boston, New York and Philadelphia celebrated New England’s victory.
Pride and confidence built as militiamen had beaten a world power. The men from
New England were kept at Louisburg, but did not receive the rewards they
expected. They performed garrison duty in the cold and rain of Cape Breton and
sickness overcame them. By the spring of 1746 almost 900 New England soldiers
had died. During the war and taking of Louisburg they had lost only 130 men.
The British took advantage, taking booty and credit for the victory. Warren and
his crews were the only actual invaders who received any of the prizes. The
officers and heroes of the campaign reveled in victory and praise. But the men
who fought became more and more discontent with the duties they were
performing. They had to stay until professional troops from Europe relieved
them in order to prevent Louisburg from being retaken by the French.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Peter Warren was named Governor and his first concern was to rid the
country of the Frenchmen. Louisburg’s elite had left after the surrender, but
it’s working people stayed. He wanted Isle Royal, Isle Saint Jean and Nova
Scotia empted, however, succeeded only on the Isle Royal. All the French
settlers on the Isle Saint Jean remained and amounted to less than 100 people.
For the next few years the powers of Acadia and Nova Scotia vacillated on the
expulsion of all Acadians and those that claimed to be neutrals. Who would
replace them? What if they resisted? What if they took up arms? What would be
done with them? Where would they go? Would they side with the French if they
invaded? Should they be replaced with good Protestants?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>In 1746 a couple different plans to invade and retake the colony in
Acadia by the French failed. Bad weather caused extreme loss of ships, supplies
and men. Again in May 1747 an armada of French ships commanded by Marquis de La
Jonquiere and Jean-Louis Le Loutre set sail for North America and were meet and
defeated badly by Admiral Peter Warren and Lord George Anson at the Battle of
Cape Ortegal. War and politics kept Europe in turmoil and Britain still could
not decide what would happen in North America. Plans to take all of Canada from
the French were made with 500 men from Britain. Support would come from the
American colonies and the naval forces from Louisburg. However, this was
postponed due to bad weather and instability in London.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The British had control of Isle Royal at Louisburg and the Nova Scotia
Peninsular with Port Royal regaining strength. However, there were still
pockets of French and French Acadians in the territory. A detachment of 470
soldiers from Massachusetts’s led by Colonel Arthur Noble moved in and occupied
the residences of Grand Pre. The French still had some troops at Beaubassin
commanded by Jean-Baptiste-Nicholas Roche de Ramezay. He made a daring move and
retook Grand Pre on a cold February morning during a snowstorm. The New
Englanders were not accustom to the snow and cold of Nova Scotia and sustained
substantial personnel loss. Peace was made and the New Englanders retreated to
Annapolis Royal. A condition of their release was a promise to not take up arms
in this territory. Confusion existed among the inhabitants as the French
commanders vacated their post. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The French would have to handle the status of the Acadian people
diplomatically. King George’s war was winding down in 1747 and diplomacy was at
work. The French regained Isle Royal and Isle Saint Jean. Louisburg was rebuilt
and became the city it was before the war. The population grew to 4,000 people.
Quebec was French territory as well, and the French also claimed the Saint John
Valley and all of main land Acadia. Britain had the Nova Scotia peninsular and
based its cultural center at Chebucto Bay, building the city of Halifax. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Acting French Governor of Canada, Roland-Michael Barrin, Marquis de La
Galissoniere challenged Mascarene’s authority at the Isthmus of Chignecto, the
Minas settlements and the Saint John Valley. Mascarene rejected this claim and
advised Governor Shirley. Both of these British officials agreed the territory
to be under British jurisdiction. La Galissoniere sent soldiers to Saint John
Harbor and ordered Louis La Corne, one of the officers at Grand Pre, to occupy
Beausejour across the Missaguash River from Beaubassin. The river being the
dividing lines between the British Nova Scotia and French main land
territories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Halifax became the capitol of British Nova Scotia. New immigrants were
brought from England, the Rhine Valley of Europe and New England. British and
New England soldiers from Louisburg were also brought to settle in the area.
They had hoped that Nova Scotia would become the fourteenth American Colony.
Colonization grew rapidly and within a couple years there were more that 5,000
people. The aged Colonel Richards Philipps was finally eased into retirement in
July 1749 and Colonel Edward Cornwallis relieved Paul Mascarene. Cornwallis
allegedly found the government he acquired in shambles and its people
uncooperative. The settlement at Halifax began to decline because the
immigrants from the different countries did not intermingle. The different
ethnic groups were; the French Loyalists, some French Acadian Neutrals, British
settlers, New Englanders and the German speaking Rhine Valley immigrants. The
Micmacs were also unhappy with the land grabbing British settlers and renewed
their raids against the settlements. The Indians had the blessing of the French
in these raids as they had in the past. Because of this unrest, the population
decreased to about 2,000 people and the administration would not be able to
sustain much aggression from an outside source.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

</span>The French Neutrals were still a troublesome group and Cornwallis was to
again bring them under British rule. His mission was also to build protestant
schools, encourage mix marriages among the different ethnic groups and award
tax-free land to Acadians who would renew oaths of allegiances without any
reservations. He gave them three mouths to oblige. The Acadian inhabitant’s
council did not change their minds in regards to the oaths. A letter signed by
one thousands Acadians advising Cornwallis that they would stand by the oaths
agreed to with John Doucett in 1717 and again with Phillips in 1730, other wise
they would leave the country. Again, the French Acadians won as Cornwallis or
the Board of Trade could not let the country be vacated, feeling that it would
strengthen the French presents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Cornwallis that the main land and Chignecto were French territory. But,
Cornwallis stood fast that they were within the boundaries of the original
Acadian lands in the 1714 Treaty of Rastadt and therefore under the British
jurisdiction. Cornwallis also warned that fighting could break out while the
two crowns debated the boundaries. In the spring of 1750 Lt. Louis La Corne had
French troops in position and well established at the heavily supplied Fort
Beausejour. La Corne would concede east of the Missaguash River to the British.
He had the missionary Jean-Louis Le Loutre and a band of Micmacs burn homes,
barns, churches and the village so to drive the settlers behind the French line
on the east bank of the river. Major Charles Lawrence brought troops from
Halifax to the Minus Basin and Chignecto Bay. When the British arrived they
found the village of Beaubassin in flames. Lawrence found himself in a poor
strategic location and retreated to the Minus Basin and then built Fort Edwards
on the Avon River in what is now Windsor. In the fall of that year Lawrence
returned to Beaubassin were he meet some resistance from Indians and then he
built Fort Lawrence across the river from Fort Beausejour. For the next five
years the two occupied forts would face each other awaiting the diplomats to
decide the boundaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

France wanted them to grow and expand on the Isle Saint Jean and Isle Royal.
While the British wanted them to stay and assimilate, become subjects and good
Protestants. Le Loutre preached and invoked damnation and Indian threats to the
people of the Chignecto Isthmus to get them to leave British territory. La
Jonquiere wanted oaths and imposed the bearing of arms on them for a militia.
This, they avoided from the British for so many years and they stood fast, not
wanting to do for the French either. The smaller villages became over crowded.
Some of the people moved to the Isle Saint Jean where it‘s population grew to
over 2,000, while others scattered to Shepody Bay, the Petitcodiac or
Memramcook River Valleys. These lands were not clear like those of the Minas
Basin where farming could be done with little labor. Those that left wanted to
return to their homes, but British authority would force them to be anglicized
and mix with the Protestants. The Acadians also feared the loss of their
Catholic religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Valley, Minus Basin and Chignecto stayed at their farms hoping for the best,
but time was running out. The diplomats and commissioners of the expanding
nations of Europe debated and attempted to resolve ownership in the territories
of North America. Acadia was a major territory at stake, as was the Ohio River
Valley. War was brought about by dispute of the Ohio River territories. George
Washington and the Virginians were defeated in a second attempt at Great
Meadows (Uniontown, Pa.) by Louis Coulon de Villiers and troops from Fort
Duquesne. Negotiations for boundaries continued. France wanted the Isthmus of
Chignecto and the mainland above Penobscot Bay, including Fort Pentagoet, Saint
Croix Island and Saint John. The British would keep the Nova Scotia Peninsular
and allow the Acadians living on the peninsular three years to leave with their
possessions if they so desired. However, in London they did not like the idea
of loosing a large number of “useful subjects“. The British on the frontier
felt entirely different than the diplomats. Cornwallis, as others preceding him
had, wanted to expel the “French Neutrals”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Louisburg had replaced Cornwallis and he was of the mind to live with the
Acadians neutrality, even though expulsion was desirable. A year later sickness
returned him to London and Charles Lawrence replaced him. To Lawrence there was
no such thing as neutrality. The inhabitants would indeed take the oaths
declined for the past 50 years or be expelled. The Board of Trade as usual
vacillated. So Lawrence held off for the time being and enforced a grain embargo
on the Acadian settlements. The farmers near Pisiquid balked and refused to cut
any additional wood for Fort Edwards. Captain Alexander Murray had the priest
jailed and ordered the people to turn in their boats and canoes. In early 1755
all their personnel arms were confiscated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

invaded the French strongholds in North America. Lawrence got reinforcements
from William Shirley in Massachusetts. Shirley enlisted 2,000 volunteers and
rendezvoused at Annapolis Royal with 250 of Lawrence’s regular army. Robert
Moncton was in command and with him was Massachusetts Colonel John Winslow.
They landed at Chignecto on June 2nd facing a French stronghold led poorly by
Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor, son of the commander who lost Louisburg in
1745. He had been more concerned with bettering his life and lining his pockets
than being a soldier. There were only 150 French troops in defense of the fort,
so the French commander sent for reinforcements from Quebec, Louisbourg and the
surrounding Acadian communities. The only response was from about 200 settlers
who agreed to help defend the fort if Duchambon would sign an agreement stating
that they were pressed into duty. After a couple week of fighting on June
16,1655 Moncton took Fort Beausejour and renamed it Fort Cumberland. The
invaders lost only 20 men to death and wounds. The surrender agreement allowed
the French soldiers and their commander to withdraw to Louisburg with a promise
not to take up arms for 6 months. Those Acadians who acted under compulsion
were pardoned. A couple weeks after the capture of Fort Beausejour, Saint John
was brought under British flag as well. The Penobscot had been void of the
French the year before. The resolution of Acadia and its inhabitants were in
the hands of Charles Lawrence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania now lies. William Shirley would lead troops
against Fort Niagara; New York and the attack on Crown Point at Lake Champlain
would be under the command of Colonel William Johnson. A British plan to

of their request after the fort had been taken and summoned the council of the
inhabitants. He attempted to force the men of the council as individuals to
swear allegiance to Britain on the spot. Taken by surprise with this request,
they procrastinated and wanted to consult their neighbors. Lawrence gave them
one night to decide. Returning the following morning the men had not changed
their minds. Lawrence denied them their request and ruled that they be
deported. The councilmen then agreed to take the oaths and Lawrence said it was
too late and jailed all the councilmen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Neutrals would be deported and scattered to various British settlements,
France, the Caribbean or where ever they could be sent. His intent was to
disperse them to other places of the world‘s civilization so their numbers
would be no threat. The Acadian land would be vacated of all inhabitants who
would not take the oaths. Lawrence had the support of Chief Justice Belcher,
who wrote the decree, two Admirals; Edward Boscawen and Savage Mostyn. Other
councilmen on his board who approved this expulsion were; William Cotterell and
Benjamin Green, two New England merchants; a British settler named John Collier
and a Captain John Rous. Ethnic cleansing, the expulsion of an entire culture,
a cruel act, for which Charles Lawrence would bear the blame, but he considered
it a military necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

started in July 1755. To carry out this treacherous act, orders were sent to
Colonel Robert Moncton at Fort Cumberland, Captain John Handfield at Annapolis
Royal, Captain Alexander Murray at Pisiquid and Colonel John Winslow at Grand
Pre. At Grand Pre, 480 inhabitants were lured to the church in the evening,
placed under confinement and the later boarded on to a transport ship. Of these
480 inhabitants, 64 carried the surname of La Blanc. Some of these La Blanc's
and many of the others that night were direct ancestors to the writer on both
the maternal and paternal (Legere) side. The officer who read the decree that
fateful night at Grand Pre was Colonel John Winslow, a relative of Beverly
Legere, wife of this writer, but not a direct descendant. An entry in his
journal stated that the act was carried out under orders, but not to his
liking. During the following months other villages were raided and the
inhabitants rounded up. Many were placed in prison at Fort Cumberland and/or
boarded on to the ships waiting at the ports. They included all men, women, and
children that they were able to capture. All homes, barns and churches were
burned and the harvested crops and livestock confiscated for the crown. The
initial deportation netted about 5,500 Acadian inhabitants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

their homeland of Acadia. Lawrence had accomplished his objective<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to empty the land of the French Acadians and
scorched the earth. There was minimal resistance by the inhabitants, but the
offences of the British were not conducted without some fighting and loss of
life. About one half of the inhabitants either left before being captured or
escaped to Isle Saint Jean (Prince Edward Island), Cape Breton, Chaleur Bay,
Quebec, Massachusetts (now Maine) and the woods of the main land (New
Brunswick). For the next couple years the roundup and deportation continued in
the Acadian territories. The British soldiers aggressively pursued the escaping
inhabitants and moved through the other villages of the main land capturing the
Acadian populace when they could and destroying property. Many of those that
escaped the deportation headed north on foot to the Cocagne region, Chaleur Bay
and the Miramichi River valley where they suffered of cold, starvation and in
many cases death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

locations and later boarded onto the ships like cattle and brought to places
unknown to the people. Some were brought to the colonies in America while
others were transported to other ports such as Louisiana, ports in the
Caribbean and as far away as the Falkland Islands. Families and friends were separated
and scatted. Some found their way to France. To the English colonists in the
New World the Acadians were Catholic, disliked, mistrusted, and misfits. They
were for the most part not welcome or wanted in the colonies either. There were
a few exceptions though, such as the Quakers of Pennsylvania. Most of the
unaccepted deportees sent to the colonies wandered and moved about the Americas
for the next few years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

suffering, disease, starvation, cold and mistreatment following the events of
1755, their numbers remained close to 12,000. These numbers stayed constant
because of the proliferation of the people. The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended
France’s governing in the North American territories. Acadian refugees would be
allowed to return to their native land near the Fundy tides and other parts of
Nova Scotia as British subjects. Those that did return, found the English
speaking Britons and New Englanders occupying Nova Scotia and the lands the

British ships. Other wayward Acadians were able to find their way to the Mississippi
bayous. In later years, after the Treaty of Paris, many other Acadians who had
been dislodged found their way to Louisiana to reunite with their families and
friends. This was the beginning of the “Cajun Culture”. Today the majority of
the inhabitants in this territory are descendants of the displaced Acadians and
related to the Acadian descendents still in the Canadian Provinces and New
England. The name Legere is a common name among these people and can be traced

</span>The rivalry of France and Britain was mirrored in the New World as war
continued between Britain and France. Louisburg had fallen into the hands of
Jeffery Amherst. Many of the Acadians that had escaped to Cape Breton during
the original deportation were sent to France, as were the soldiers of the
garrison. In 1759 Governor Pownal at Fort Point (Stockton, Maine) crossed the
Penobscot Bay and raised the Union Jack at the abandon fort in Pentagoet. The
same year British soldiers under the command of Brigadier General James Wolfe
moved up from the Colonies in the south and retook Fort Carillon on Lake
Champlain and Fort Niagara. They continued to advance toward Quebec and mounted
an attack on the French General Louis-Joseph Montcalm. Fierce battles followed
and Wolfe was finally able to force a pass up the cliffs of Quebec and defeated
Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham. Casualties ran high taking many of the
civilian population as well as soldiers and both commanders were killed in
battle. Colonel Pierre Rigaud de Vaudreuil took command and retreated toward
Montreal with the remaining French troops. The British continued their pursuit
after Amherst arrived from Louisburg to take command and he forced Vaudreuil to
surrender in 1760. After “The Conquest” Amherst did not deport the remaining
inhabitants of Quebec as the British had done in Acadia. He offered them
property rights, the use of the French language, the retention of their culture
and freedom to practice their Catholic religion. Most of the high-ranking
officials and soldiers were sent to France. The majority of the inhabitants
stayed and accepted the conditions, as they had no real ties to France and most
were Canadian born. These actions were ratified at a later time by the Quebec
Act of 1774.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>It was in 1766 that the Minus d’Entremont families together with other
Acadian exiles, Amirault, Belliveau and Duon (d’Eon) returned from Salem,
Massachusetts to Pobomcoup. They found their barony and the Barrington region,
where they had lived prior to the expulsion of 1755, occupied by the Loyalists
from New England. They then chose to settle on vacant land, west of the harbor
on the peninsular in East Pubnico. Other exile Acadians joined them and today
the regions is populated mostly by Acadian descendants of the people who twice
had settled in the region. Pubnico is the oldest village in Acadia still
occupied by Acadians descendants from the original founding settlers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Nova Scotia and the Acadian territory would remain British territory.
The Acadians that returned to Acadia found new lands, continued to live in
peace and raise their large families. They were able to keep their language and
pretty much maintain their cultures. The Catholic Church stilled played a major
part of their customs. Land grants were awarded or they were able to purchase
large tracts of land for farming. The fishing trade also flourished. Villages
such as Caraquet, Miramichi, Richibucto, Memramcook, Shediac, Cape Pele,
Sackville, Dorchester Crossing, Rogersville, Dieppe, Moncton, Shemogue,
Aboujagane, Robichard, Barachois, and Scoudouc sprouted throughout the main
land of New Brunswick. Many of the villages carried the family name of the
founding settler. Today there are thousands of inhabitants with the same family
names in the villages of New Brunswick that are descendents of the original
founders or the repatriated Acadians. The Acadian flag below was established in
1784.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Pentagoet was in the hands of the British after the American Revolution.
In 1779, British General Francis McLean landed with two regiments and built
Fort George on the highest point on the peninsular. The Revolutionist began to
realize the importance of keeping the peninsular in their custody. The
Massachusetts Board of War organized a large armada to regain Pentagoet with 18
armed vessels, 24 transport ships, 1,000 militiamen and 400 marines. Commodore
Dudley Saltonstall led the naval forces. Brigadier General Solomon Lowell led
the land forces with General Peleg Wadsworth and Colonel Paul Revere. General
Mc Lean was able to summon the superior British naval forces from Halifax to
assist in the defense of Pentagoet and they drove the Americans up the
Penobscot River forcing them to scuttle their ships. This 1779 invasion
resulted in one of the worst American naval defeats in history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Under British control Pentagoet became a desirable place to reside for
Loyalist sympathizers, as they believed it to be in Acadia. Those in New
England who swore allegiance to Britain were forced to abandon their farms and
business. Many of the Loyalist, including some settlers from Falmouth
(Portland, Maine), decided to move to the friendlier British settlement where
they built new homes. When the Treaty of Paris was signed, the Acadian boarder
was set at the Saint Croix River. So after the revolution these same Loyalists
found themselves in revolutionary territory and were again forced to move. Some
dismantled their homes, loaded them onto ships or barges and transported them to
Saint Andrews, New Brunswick. Today some of the loyalist’s homes in both
Castine and Saint Andrews are still standing. During the next few years other
Loyalists wanting to remain loyal to the British crown also emigrated from the
United States to the Saint John Valley in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Until the war of 1812 the town of Castine was very prosperous with
shipbuilding, merchant shipping and lumbering. Having lost Castine in 1812, the
British retook the town in 1814 because of its strategic location. The town
continued to nourish and the British began reworking on the canal between
Wadsworth Cove and Hatch Cove that had begun during their previous occupation.
On April 15, 1815 the British were again evacuated and the American town of Castine
once again became a major seaport and business community. The Civil war,
railroading and the decline of sailing ships brought about a decline in the
economic well being of Castine. However, from 1870 through 1890 steam boating
and tourism had a slight impact. Eastern State Normal began in 1867 and moved
into the two large buildings in the shadows of Fort George at the head of Main
and Pleasant Streets in 1873. It was 1941 when Maine Maritime Academy was
founded and occupied these two buildings in 1942 when the Normal School ceased
to operate. These two buildings renamed Dismukes Hall and Leavitt Hall were
renovated and continue to function as the center of the internationally known
maritime academy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The Maritime Provinces grew over the next few decades after peace was
restored. Prince Edward Island had split from Nova Scotia in 1769, as did New
Brunswick in 1784. Ontario separated from Quebec by a constitutional act and
became Upper Canada in 1791. Upper Canada was governed by English common law,
whereas Quebec maintained French law and was known as Lower Canada. The
Catholic Church directed the culture of Quebec, like in Acadia. It repressed
the mentality, ideas, aspirations, values, priorities and morals of the
inhabitants. The Pastor of the church was in control of society and directed
the inhabitant’s way of life. The government governed, but delegated education
to the church that also owned and operated hospitals, health care facilities,
nursing homes and orphanages. Due to a high birth rate, Quebec experienced a
higher increase in population than that of Acadia. In 1663 there were 3,000
inhabitants and it grew to 65,000 by 1759. Trois Rivieres was the center for
iron production and the making of tools, plows and anchors. By 1840 Quebec had
grown to 600,000 people. It was not until 1820 when Cape Breton Island reunited
with Nova Scotia. The British North American Act of 1867 formed a new nation
Canada, and included the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and
Ontario. Prince Edward Island became a province of Canada in 1873.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>French-Canadian migration from Quebec and Acadia to Maine and New
England began in 1850 and continued for the next 100 years. The elite and the
Catholic Church controlled the social and economic condition of Canada. The
farmers being suppressed, as they were, caused them to look toward the States
for employment and a more prosperous life. Society in Quebec basically
continued to be feudal and the farmers made up the larger percentages of the
population. The volume of migration threatened Canadian-French culture and to
combat this upheaval, the Province opened up large tracts of land previously
held back from the lowly farmers. That not working, they turned to propaganda
degrading these people to be stupid, lazy, drunken wastrels and afraid to work
Those that were less fortunate had sustained a menial livelihood up to that
point and had nothing to loose by moving to the states. Migration continuing,
the Catholic Church and Quebec Province turned to threats and propaganda. This
was a position opposite from what had been promoted. They degraded the
communities in the states as decadence and sinful for the far better Frenchman.
Their thinking was that they could infiltrate their society in the state and still
have influence over their people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The mill towns of Maine and other New England states experienced
substantial growth in their population from the French Canadians who went to
work in the textile and paper mills. The State of Maine population at one time
exceeded better than 50 percent French Canadian heritage. The demographics have
changed over the years and in 1990 the percentage of French Canadians was down
to 27 percent further declining to 23 percent the following decade. However,
some of the smaller mill towns have retained large percentages of French
Canadian inhabitants who are descendants of the original Acadian and Canadian
settlers.</span></p><p align="center">MATERNAL ANCESTORS OF

</span>A number of ancestors on the Legere maternal side back through the generations
have already been mentioned. Following are some of those and additional ones
that are known to have been among the inhabitants of Acadia during the first
100 years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The ship “L'Oranger” arrived in Acadia in 1671 with a number of new
settlers. Among this group was Francois Amirault (1654-) from Tours, France. He
was seven years old at the time and it is assumed that he was orphaned, as the
passenger list did not include his parents. In 1683 at Port Royal, Francois
Amirault married Marie Petre (1666) the daughter of Jean Petre (1636-1689), and
Marie Pesselet (1641-). Francois Amirault and Marie Petre were parents to 10
children. Their daughter Anne (1691-) married Jacques Legere II, three sons
married three Laure sisters and two of the siblings married into the
d’Entremont family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Antoine Babin (1625-) married Marie Mercer (1646-) at Port Royal in 1661
having arrived the pervious year from La Chaussee, France. They were parents to
seven children. A daughter Catherine Babin (1671-) married Jean-Augustin Comeau
(1665-) a son of Pierre Comeau and Rose Bayolle. Descendants of Antoine and
Marie are numerous, as many were able to escape the deportation of 1755 to
Quebec or the Gaspe Peninsular. The Babin family descendants are also found in
a number of villages throughout New Brunswick and are among the Legere
ancestry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>There was a Louis Blanchard who came to Acadia on the ship “Saint Jehan”
in 1636. He is not in any of the early censors and therefore assumed that he
returned to France. The first Blanchard on record is Jean Blanchard born in
1611, the son of Guillaume Blanchard (1590-) and Huguette Poirier. They were
from the Martaize region, near Poitiers, France where many of the early Acadian
settlers came from. Jean Blanchard married Radegonde Lambert (1629-) in 1642
and were parents to six children, of which three, Madeleine (1643-), Anne
(1645-) and Guillaume (1650-) are ancestors. Guillaume (1650-) married Huguette
Gougeon (1657-) in 1672 and had twelve children. Their daughter Anne (1684-)
married to Claude Bourgeois (1674-) is the only ancestor of the twelve children
in the Legere maternal table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Alexander Bourg a son of Francoise and Marguerite Boudreau studied in
France and returned to Acadia to become the Kings Notary in Grand Pre. His wife
was Marguerite Melanson daughter of Pierre Melanson and Marie Marguerite Mius
D’Entremont. Renee Bourg (1655) died about 1685 and her husband, Charles
Boudreau, remarried Marie Corporon and had 9 additional children. From the
original family, the next generation and the generations that followed, there
are thousands of descendants of Antoine Bourg and Antoinette Landry. Down
through the generations the spelling of the family name has varied such as
Bourque, Bourc, Bourk, or Bour, but Bourg is used in the text.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

son of Jacques Bourgeois, I, Jacques Bourgeois, II (1618-1701) was one of the
early inhabitants that stayed in Acadia in 1655. In 1642 he joined his father
and brother Robert in Acadia and became the Governor’s Surgeon General of
Acadia. Governor D’Aulnay had granted the island of Cochons in the Dauphin
River to him and he became a prosperous farmer as well. This river later became
the Port Royal River and is now called the Annapolis River. In 1644 Jacques
Bourgeois, II married Jeanne Trahan (1629-) when she was 16. She was the
daughter of Guillaume Trahan and Francoise Carbonneau, who arrived on the
“Saint Jehan” in 1636. Jacques, II and Jeanne had ten children. Five of their
children are found in the maternal line of the Legere genealogy and three
children married into the Dugas family, another large family in the settlement.
Many other descendants of Jacques, II and Jeanne are also in the ancestral
line. Jacques Bourgeois, II founded the settlement of Chignecto in the Minus
Basin in 1672 with five other families which included Pierre Cyr and Germain
Girouard, sons-in-law to Jacques Bourgeois, II; Jacques Below, brother-in-law
to Pierre Cyr; Pierre Arsenault; and Thomas Cormier with his wife Madeleine
Girouard, a sister to Germain Girouard. It was known as the Bourgeois Colony
and in 1676 was renamed Beaubassin by Michel Leneuf de la Valliere and again
renamed Amherst after the British Conquest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(1597-1690). In 1649 he married Rose Bayolle the daughter of Nicolas Bayolle

they had 19 children between 1678 and 1708. Pierre (1653-1730) and some of his
sons and grandsons had farms neighboring the farm of Jacques Legere, (“The
Stump”) along the banks of the Port Royal River. A son Abraham Comeau (1679-)
married to Marguerite Petre had two daughters, Marguerite and Madeleine who
married two sons of Jacques Legere and Madeleine Trahan, Jean and Francois. The

</span>It was in 1644 that Robert Cormier, his wife Marie Peraude and their son
Thomas arrived at Fort Saint-Pierre, Cape Breton from La Rochelle, France. The
following year their son Jean was born when the Cormier family were residing in
Port Royal. Thomas Cormier married Madeleine Girouard at Port Royal in 1668.
Madeleine was 14 years old and the daughter of the early settlers Francois
Girouard and Jeanne Aucoin. Thomas and Madeleine were parents to nine children
who married into the next generation of the Acadians families of Boudreau, La
Blanc, Hache-Gallant, Cyr and Poirier. Three sons married daughters of Jacque
La Blanc and Catherine Hebert and another son married a daughter of Andre La
Blanc and Marie Dugas, Andre and Jacques were brothers. Daughters Marie and
Agnes Cormier married brothers Jean-Baptiste and Pierre Poirier. A daughter
Madeleine Cormier married Michael Boudreau, the son of Michael Boudreau, the
Judge and Lieutenant General. Daughter Clair Cormier married Pierre Cyr and
daughter Anne Cormier married Michael-Hache Gallant. Thomas Cormier with his
family left Port Royal in 1676 with other settlers that founded the village
that became Beaubassin and there he became a very prosperous farmer. Three of
the Thomas Cormier children and many other descendants can be found in the
Legere ancestry. There are thousands of Cormier’s and other Acadian descendants
that come from this Acadian pioneer family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The first Cyr in Acadia was Pierre Sire (1644-1680) a soldier at the
fort in Port Royal. In 1670 he married Marie Bourgeois the daughter of Jacques
Bourgeois and Jeanne Trahan. He and Marie had three sons, Jean (1671-), Pierre
(1678-) and Guillaume (1680-) who married into other ancestral families,
Melanson, Cormier and Bourg. Pierre Sire, Marie Bourgeois and their son Jean
(1671-) were among the settlers that went to Chignecto with her father in 1672.
Pierre died in 1780 and Marie became the wife of Germain Girouard, son of
Francoise Girouard and Jeanne Aucoin. Germain Girouard was a brother to Marie,
Madeleine and Anne who are all ancestors. The name Sire was changed to Cyr in
the early settlement and Pierre’s children’s children spread to all the Acadian
villages. This family, as all other Acadian families, suffered the effects of
the 1755 deportation. There are thousands of descendants of Pierre and his
three sons through out Canada and the United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

officer Philippe Mius d’Entremont (1609-1700), a maternal ancestor. D’Entremont
was also his Attorney General and had to be fairly close to La Tour. The
Governor gave d’Entremont his choice of where he would like to live and he
chose what was then known as Pobomcoup at Cape Sable, today called Pubnico. La
Tour created a barony for him and bestowed a title. Philippe moved there in
1653 with his wife Madeleine Helie and daughter Marie-Marguerite (1649-) who
had come with him from France. Three sons, Jacques (1654-), Abraham (1658-) and
Philippe, II (1660-) and another daughter Madeline (1669-) were born to
Philippe Mius d’Entremont and Madeline Helie while living in Pobomcoup. A manor
house had been built at the barony and stood there for over for 100 years until
after the expulsion when the British burned it to the ground in 1758. It was in
1700 while living with his daughter in Grand Pre that the patriarch, Philippe,

</span>Abraham Dugas (1616-1698) was Armourer and Lieutenant General of the
King in Acadia and later a successful farmer of the territory. He was one of
the early settlers and was very influential. In 1647 he married
Marguerite-Louise Doucet (1634-), the daughter of Germain Doucet, D’Aulnay’s
staff officer. He and Marguerite had 8 children of which six are direct
ancestors on the maternal side of the Legere’s, having married into the
Bourgeois, Melanson, Arsenault and Le Blanc families. His granddaughter Anne
Melanson (1664), daughter of Charles Melanson (1643-1700) and Marie Dugas
(1648-1737) married Jacques La Tour, the son of Charles La Tour and Jeanne
Motin. Anne is a sister to Isabelle Melanson married to Michael Bourg (1665),

</span>Michael Hache’ had arrived in Chignecto in 1676 with Michael Leneuf de
La Valliere. It was about 1713 that Michael Hache’ became known as Michael
Hache’ Gallant. During one of the raids on Beaubassin by the British, Michael
and his oldest son encountered a Captain Blackmore on board a British sloop. A
detachment from the sloop pursued the French vessel into the creek and captured
it. They were left on board their own vessel under guard. During the night
Michael over powered the guards, put them in a canoe and escaped under sail on
his own vessel. The next morning Captain Blackmore in a larger sloop caught up
with Michael, re-captured him and took him prisoner. Exhibiting this extreme
bravery, Michael was dubbed “Galland” by his enemy's, thus be became known as
the “Gallant One” and there after carried the sir name Hache‘ Gallant. A
captive of the British he eventually was brought before a court. The governor
thought that a sentence to death would be the most appropriate, but the court
could not find him guilty of the charges. Paul Mascarene, born a Frenchman, was
the presiding British officer and probably had reservations in condemning a
fellow Frenchman to death. The outcome of this sentence was kept secret from
the inhabitants allowing them to think the he had been condemned to death.
However, he was later released from custody. Michael is an ancestor on the
maternal side of the Legere family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Michael Hache-Gallant decided that he was not going to take any oaths to
the British Crown, so in 1715 he elected to leave Beaubassin with a few other
families and moved to Isle Saint Jean, now known as Prince Edward Island.
Michael was of stature at Beaubassin and therefore carried his prominence to
the island. After the French Government assigned Comte Saint-Pierre Seigneur of
the island, Michael was appointed Captain of the Port at Port La Joy. By 1721
there were sixteen families from France and four from Acadia residing on the
island. Michael and his wife were parents to twelve children, all of which also
resided on Isle Saint Jean. Michael Hache-Gallant, II later returned to
Beaubassin becoming a British Subject. Joseph the second son of Michael
Hache-Gallant succeeded his father as the Captain of the Port. In his ageing
years Michael Hache-Gallant set up a retirement plan for he and his wife of
substance from their children, were by they would provide for their parents for
life. On April 10, 1737 Michael fell through thin nice on the North River and
his body was not recovered until July of the same year. Anne Cormier, Michael’s
widow, returned to live with her son Michael Hache-Gallant, II, at Beaubassin.
Many descendants of Michael Hache-Gallant have dropped Hache and use the sir
name Gallant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Michael Hache-Gallant, II (1691-1765) the son of Michael and Anne
Cormier married Madeline La Blanc, the daughter of Jacques La Blanc and
Catherine Hebert at Grand Pre on October 12, 1711. Her parents were among the
founders of Grand Pre and she was the grand- daughter of the early Port Royal
settlers. These people are found in the maternal Legere ancestry. Michael was
with his father at the time of his father‘s gallant episode and Michael
experienced many horrors of war throughout his lifetime. He had survived the
attacks and burning of Beaubassin, gone to Isle Saint-Jean with his father,
returned to Beaubassin and became a British subject. He eventually found his
way to France where he died in 1765. The children of Michael Hache-Gallant, II

horrors of 1755 and the few years that followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thomas Temple in 1657. He had married Pricilla Melanson from Scotland in 1630.
They had three sons, Pierre (1632-), Charles (1642-) and David. Pierre and
Charles took the surname of their mother, Melanson. In Port Royal they married
into two well-known Acadian families. Pierre Melanson married Marie Marguerite
Mius d’Entremont in 1664. She was the daughter of Philippe Mius d’Entremont,
Baron of Pobomcoup and Madeline Helie. Pierre Melanson and Marie Marguerite
d’Entremont were among the founders of Grand Pre. Charles Melanson married
Marie Dugas the daughter of Abraham Dugas, Lieutenant General of the King in
Acadia and Marguerite-Louise Doucet, the daughter of Germain Doucet dit
Laverdure, Commander at the original Port Royal colony. Pierre and Charles
Melanson both had large families with 24 children between them. Thus there are
numerous descendants of theirs throughout Canada and United States. Some of
their descendants adopted a variation of spelling the family name. The above
families are found in the maternal genealogy of the Legere family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1660 Pierre married at Port Royal to Jeanne Theriault the daughter of early
settlers Jehan Theriault (1601-) and Perrine Rau (1611-). Pierre decided to
remain in Acadia and became a successful farmer and built the first flour mill
in Acadia at Pre Ronde on the riverbank a few miles north of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Port Royal. He and Jeanne had 16 children, 7
sons and 9 daughters. Their children all married at Port Royal and some of them
to the most influential people of Port Royal and Acadia. A daughter, Jeanne
(1672-) married Mathieu de Goutin, King’s Councilor and Lieutenant General of
Justus in Acadia. Daughter Cecile (1680-) married Emmanuel Le Borgne, son of
Alexander Le Borgne and Marie de Saint Etienne de La Tour and daughter Marie

</span>In 1698 Pierre Thibodeau resettled at Chipoudy, founding this community
on the Chipoudy River with four of his sons, Pierre, Jean, Antoine and Michel
and a friend Pierre Gaudet. The location of this settlement is now Hopewell,
New Brunswick. Pierre left his sons at the new settlement to return to Port
Royal for supplies. On the voyage back to Chipoudy Pierre was accompanied by
additional adventurous settlers, Guillaume Blanchard (1650-), three of his sons
Rene, Antoine and Jean; Guillaume’s son-in-law Oliver Daigle and two nephews,
sons of Pierre Gaudet and Marie Blanchard. When they arrived in the valley,
Guillaume Blanchard and his family continued up the Petitcodiac River and
founded the settlement of Blanchard. During the next couple years voyages would
be made back to Port Royal for additional supplies and they would also return
with spouses, new settlers or intended wives. By 1702 the population of these
two communities had increased to 48 inhabitants. The Thibodeau family
intertwines with most all families of Acadian heritage, including the Legere
family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

“legere” is light, as light in weight. It was not until the twelfth century
that society adopted sir names. Prior to that, individuals went by their given
names only. As history reveals, sir names were derived from many means such as
by occupation, vocation, appearance, colors, geographical origins, nick names
and other identifying methods. Aliases were common and some used patrons or
lords to identify their families. It wasn’t until late in the eighteenth
century that the French Crown ordered all citizens to use their family sir
names. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

by many from Saint Legere, a patron and famous saint approaching the notoriety
of Saint Martin of Tours. Others may have taken the name as an identity of
their size in weight or complexion of their skin. The spelling differences of
the name, Legere and Leger, are derivatives of the gender spelling and in some
cases the way the name was documented by the censor’s takers or told by the
individuals. Many of the early settlers in Acadia were illiterate and unable to
properly record documents. The writer has use “Legere” in this script, but it
is acknowledged that some the people herein may have used or do use, “Leger”.
Legare was also found in areas other than Acadia and it is possible that came
from Legere. The research of that in itself would be very extensive and the
findings interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

identify families or individuals during in the medieval period. Warriors wore heavy
metal armor and it became difficult to distinguish the soldiers, so the use of
a coat of arms inscribed on the shield of the soldier was used for
identification. The coat of arms was designed and scripted similar to the
adoption of a sir name. Through the centuries the coat of arms remained as
identification of families and were passed on to the next generation. The first
coat of arms (see appendix B) is alleged to be the official blazon registered
in the name Legere. The second coat of arms illustrated (see appendix B)
depicts a drum and roses and supposedly is the blazon of Jacques Legere. The
early settlers of Acadia did not use coats of arms and it is believed that this
was probably a design illustrated by a more recent descendant of Jacques Legere
dit La Rosette. The literal translation of the Latin on this coat of arms is
“Legere Faithful to Country ”. The crest does make a pleasant family
symbol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

beginning with the ancestry in Acadia during the 17th century. It was this
period of time that the Europeans were settling in the Americas. Although the
name appears a few times in the early settlement of Quebec, it was not pursued
in any detail other than indicated in this research. Family ties could have
been connected in France prior to the new settler arriving, but again that
research was not pursued. During and after the 1755 deportation of the French
Acadians by the British from Acadia the name and descendants did spread to
other parts of Canada and the American Colonies. All Legere's that are

(1663-1751). France was the birthplace of Jacques about 1663. It is believed
that his father was also named Jacques and born in 1645. Many searches have
been made to trace his ancestry, but there have been no conclusions. His actual
place of birth or date has not been confirmed either. It is believed that he
arrived in Acadia on the French frigate “La Friponne” in 1687, a
soldier/drummer in the company of Sieur de Villieu, a Naval detachment. He also
had duties at Port Royal as a soldier and was probably with Joseph de Villebon in
his defeat of William Phips at Cape Tourmente in 1690. In 1691 Jacques, the
soldier, performed duties at Fort Naschouac, also known as Fort Saint Joseph,
in what is now Fredericton, New Brunswick, on the Saint John River. It is from
this fort that many raids by the French soldiers and the Indians originated,
including the attract and seizure of Fort Henry at Pemaquid, now Woolwich,
Maine. Jacques was known as La Rosette when a soldier and we believe that this
nickname came about from the arrangement of rose symbols on his drum. As was
the custom, the soldiers were encouraged to stay in Acadia and find new lives
after they completed their military service. Jacques most probably became
acquainted with Madeline Trahan (1677-1742), daughter of Guillaume Trahan (1611-1682)
and Madeline Brun (1645-), while he was stationed at Port Royal. Madeline
Trahan was 15 years old when they were married at Port Royal in 1693. Jacques
and Madeline lived on the farm with Madeline’s stepfather Pierre de Bezier for
a short time and then Jacques became a prosperous farmer himself on adjacent
land along the east bank of the Port Royal River. They were neighbors to Pierre
Thibodeau, the miller, and the Pierre Comeau families. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as La Rosette Village and is now called the Rosette Marsh. It is located about
four and one half miles north of Annapolis Royal on Route 201. Next to this
property today is The Rosette Anglican Church. Jacques and Madeline had ten
children, all raised on their homestead. Madeline died December 9, 1742 and was
buried in the Saint-Jean The Baptist Catholic Church graveyard in Annapolis
Royal. Jacques dit La Rosette Legere died on March 8, 1751 and was buried next
to his wife. The Catholic Church in Port Royal was replaced in 1822 by Saint
Luke’s Anglican Church. Today both Acadians and English are buried in the
graveyard beside the church on Upper Saint George Street in Annapolis Royal.
Jacques lived through 60 years of minimal growth, wars and strife in Acadia,
but he or Madeline did not live to go through the horrors or brutality of the
deportation in 1755. By that time only four of his 10 children were still
living. They together with 24 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren
experienced those sufferings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(1666-) at Port Royal. Francois Amirault arrived in Acadia in 1671 at the age
of 7 on the ship “L’Oranger”. Marie was the daughter of Jean Pitre (1636-1689)
and Marie Pesselet (1641-), some of the original settlers in Acadia. In 1721
Jacques II and his family, Anne and 3 children, left La Rosette Village outside
of Port Royal and moved to the mouth of the Petcoudiac River across the Bay of
Fundy to Blanchard Village. Today the spot is called Milk Creek or Edgett’s
Landing in Hillsborough, New Brunswick. Jacques II was the first Legere to
settle in New Brunswick. He was a craftsman and the museum at Beausejour now
exhibits two of his chairs made in 1720. When the British troops were rounding
up the Acadian inhabitants for deportation in 1755, they approached Blanchard
Village and meet resistance led by a French officer named Charles Deschamps de
Boishebert. After a 3-hour battle the British soldiers retreated. The
inhabitants then abandoned the village and fled north toward the Cocagne region
and the Miramichi River. The trip was to exhausting for Jacques II and Anne and
neither were able to survive the suffering and fatigue, as was the situation
for many of the escaping Acadians. Jacques Legere, II is a direct descendant of

and inherited his father’s property at La Rosette Village. However, a few years

Scholastique (1744-), Francois (1746-), Charles (1749-1837), Marguerite (1751-)

Acadia to Connecticut in 1755 with some of his family and there are no other
traces of him. However, there is a Francois Legere buried in Barachois and
could possibly be him. His wife Madeline Comeau and some of their children took
refuge in the forest where she and some of the children died of hunger and
misery. A Paul Legere born in New York in 1759 reportedly was a son of Francois

Francoise Legere and Madeline Comeau became separated from his parents during
the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. He was six years old at the time and was
adopted by his Godmother Marguerite Grosvalet (1731-1769) who was with the
family when they took refuge in the forest. Marguerite was married to Pierre
Legere son of Jacques II and a cousin to Charles. Her parents were Francois
Grosvalet and Angelique Mius D’Entremont, a descendant of the original family
from Pubnico. During the expulsion Marguerite and Charles took refuge first at
Chipoudie and then to the Isle of Saint Jean where she raised Charles as her
own child. At the age of 18, Charles and his Godmother returned to Menoudie,
Nova Scotia near Beaubassin. Marguerite Grosvalet died in 1769 and Charles
stayed in Menoudie until he was 25 years old, then moving to Petitcodiac. In
1778 Charles married Marie Marguerite Bourque (1763-1807) the daughter of Michael
Bourque (1719-1790) and Marguerite Bourgeois (1720-). They lived in Petitcodiac
for a couple years and relocated to Menoudie until 1802. Charles (1749-1837)
with his sons Charles and Simon and their families were among 16 Acadian
families from Petitcodiac and Menoudie that founded the village of Shemogue,
New Brunswick. It was this group of pioneers that also founded the church
parishes of Cape Pele and Shemogue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Trois-Ruisseau-des-Legere (Three Rivers) to live with his son Francois until
his death in 1837 at the age of 88. There were many descendants of Jacques
Legere living in Trois-Ruisseau and the village was called La Rosette until
about 1900. The area is now referred to as Legere‘s Brook and in the town of

(1783-1827); a brother to Francois (1794-1868), obtained some land at Cap Pele.
On December 30, 1817 three of his brothers, Paul, Moise and Francois
(1794-1868) each purchased 800 acres of land near Simon in the village of
Trois-Ruisseau-des-Legere. The four brothers, sons of Charles Legere and Marie
Marguerite Bourque, had been living in Shemogue, but were born in Menoudie
where their parents lived at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Simon was married to Isabelle Le Blanc (1789-), with two children at
that time. Paul, 27 years of age, was married to Marie Melanson (1791-1888),

Bonnevie (1796-1889) in 1817 at Shemogue. She was the daughter of Joseph
Bonnevie (1772-) and Anastasie Babineau. Joseph Bonnevie was one of the
original settlers at Shemogue. Anastasie's mother was Marguerite Legere the
daughter of Joseph (1720-1806) and the grand daughter of Jacques II
(1695-1758). Francois was using the sir name Larosette. Some of the family
members used Larosette as the family name in place of Legere at that time. In
the early eight-teen hundreds, Larosette was dropped and replaced by all family
members with Legere or Leger. The different spellings are adaptations of the
masculine and feminine genders of the sir name. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

their families fully occupied. All of the brothers carried on a tradition of
the family and custom of the Acadians, producing large families. Collectively
these four brothers fostered 48 children. The children of Francois Legere and
Marguerite Bonnevie were; Thaddee (1818-1879), Fidele (1820-1921), Maxime

(1833-). As a young man Francois was diagnosed with consumption (Tuberculosis)
and went to sea on board a ship for a period of two years. The reasoning to go
to sea was that the sea air was supposed to be an effective remedy for the
illness. While living in Cape Pele they had three children; Adeline was born in
1879 and died at age three while Francois was at sea. She had fallen from a
ladder to the bedroom loft and died as a result of a head injury. Alphie was

(9/22/1891-4/22/1973) was born in Portland, Maine. His mother, Dina Porelle,
gave birth to him at home. At that time they lived on Green Street which was
located where the rose garden is now in Deering Oaks Park across the street
from the Portland Post Office on Forest Avenue. As a youth the family lived in
the heavier populated sections of the city near the waterfront. Philip’s
education was limited to the eighth grade at the Staples elementary school. He
was as active baseball player throughout his teens. Small in size, but big in
stature. He acquired the nickname “Pug’ as a youth. At a very young age he
became an apprentice baker working in Combs Bakery in the West End of Portland.
Philip made a few coastal voyages on the steamer “Rockland” employed as a
baker. He then went ashore, going to work for the Armstrong Company, the food
services contractor for the railroad serving Portland. Prior to World War I,
Philip meet Marie Lobertine Hamanne (1893-1982) introduced by a mutual friend
(Belle Huedon) on a blind date. Marie was the daughter of Amedee Hamanne
(1861-1919) and Odile Carrier (1860-1937).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

November 28, 1893 in Berlin, New Hampshire. Her father Amedee was a shoe cobbler
and when Marie was seven years old the family moved to Rumford, Maine. Amedee
and Odile were parents to 14 children, five of which died before they reached
the age of three. Refer to tables for names of their children. Nicholas, the
first Hamanne in the Americas, (See Hamanne family in next chapter) was born in
what is now Germany, his wife Isabelle was French and living in Quebec, the
language spoken was French. The family decedents from there on were French and
their language continued to be French. A larger percentage of the inhabitants
in the mill towns of Maine, such as Rumford, were Canadian French and they
spoke the French language. Marie was a teenager before she learned to speak
English. As was the custom of the day, education was not a priority for the
children. When Marie completed elementary school she stayed at home to help
attend to the younger children of the family. Upon reaching the age of 17,
Marie was old enough to leave home, so she went to Portland, Maine and found
employment as a domestic for a Doctor Robinson. It was in Portland that Marie
and Philip meet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

married at Saint Dominic's Church in Portland, Maine. When World War I broke
out Philip did not serve in the military, as he was exempt because of his
paternal status. They lived on the Portland peninsular and moved to South
Portland in 1932. They had nine children, three girls (Marjorie, Phyllis and
Loraine) and six boys (Philip, Thomas, Edward, Francis, Gerard and Roger). All
of the children had strong supervision and direction from both parents. The
children all worked part time jobs in their teen years caddying on the golf
course, delivering news papers, working on the truck farms of Cape Elizabeth or
working on the Casco Bay Lines passenger ferries. Tom started working a paper
route in South Portland and the route remained in the family for 18 years,
passing it along to the next younger brother. Tom was also the first of five
brothers to work at Casco Bay Lines during their high school years. Each child
completed high school educations and the four youngest with determination,
sacrifice and aid were fortunate enough to graduate from college. All of their
children were veterans of military service, including the three girls. The five
older members of the family performed active military duty during World War II,
some of which was in hostile action. One son served between World War II the
Korean War and two other sons were in the military during the Korean Conflict,
one in combat. The youngest did not serve in wartime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

restaurants in the greater Portland area. He own and operate his own bakery in
the Woodfords section of Portland for a short time. Pot pies were his specialty
in the bakery, but the lack of business knowledge and his graciousness caused
the business to fail. For a short period of time during World War II, Philip
left the bakery trade and went to work in the shipyards of South Portland.
There, patriotic hard working men and women made exceptional wages building
Victory ships and Liberty ships used to transport supplies to the war fronts.
He then returned to his baking trade. A baker’s day starts in the early A.M., as
the pastries must be fresh each day. A three mile plus walk from his home and
across the old “Million Dollar” bridge to Portland downtown before day break
was a common occurrence if either he or the first bus was running late. Most
other early risers in downtown Portland and the policeman on the beat knew Phil
well. There was always a cup of coffee and a pastry ready for a visitor at the
bakeshop. A lover of music he always enjoyed singing and sang for many
barbershop quartets. In his young adult years he played the drums and was an
end man in many minstrel shows. These were usually put on to raise money for an
organization or church. A typical song and dance man. Things always reminded
him of a song and he would break out with a tune.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

always had a second job to help support his large family. These efforts were
spent in the field of sports and athletics. He worked with the youth developing
sports leagues and teams, teaching the young boys of South Portland football,
basketball or baseball techniques and good sportsmanship. When little league
baseball arrived in greater Portland he became a director. South Portland
benefited most from his passion for helping boys in sports. Adult sports
activities also fell within his supervision, directing basketball and softball
leagues and teams. Weather it was monetary or not, he was involved. Phil had
been a baker for over fifty years before retiring in the middle nineteen
fifties. But his strong interest in sports was lifetime. He worked a few years
part time for his son Thomas when he purchased a local tavern in South Portland
and after it was sold he continued part time there and at another local tavern.
These were the local sports bars and gathering places for the athletes of the
time and Phil could spend hours in the sports environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

youth, church and the Knights of Columbus, a two time Past Grand Knight and a
member of the Fourth Degree in the Knights of Columbus. Numerous other
organizations benefited from his kindness when they were in need of services
for raising money. He had an abiding gift of good cheer, spirit, humor and
interest in the young. Everybody was “A nice guy”. Slowing down was not in his
vocabulary, even after losing his eyesight in his later years. The daily walks
to the Knightville part of South Portland and making his stops to visit and
discuss the daily sport events along the way was truly missed after his
passing. Many years were spent on the advisory board of the South Portland Park
and Recreation Department and the City of South Portland in 1968 fittingly
named a park and playground on Waterman Drive in his honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

leadership of their father and guidance of their mother to write a unique story
unlikely to be matched in local sports, with few rivals anywhere. The good all
round athletes divided evenly between Cheverus High School, Portland’s Catholic
school, and South Portland High School. Their sports abilities and competition
spanned many years and at times competing against other. The high point in
Phil’s sports pride came when he assembled his six boys on the same basketball
team. Over a span of ten years they successfully competed against the local
college, adult basketball teams and another brother team.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
