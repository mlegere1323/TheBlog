<h3>A bit of background...</h3>  
  
  My grandfather (Roger Colin Legere) gave me his geneology website (the former URL: `http://www.legerefamilytree.com/`) on a CD back inthe early 2000s as a set of HTML files. Additionally, on that CD were the applications he had downloaded onto his computer which he'd used to generate family tree data via now-retired web services, websites and ancestry registries. I've been working on getting everything working again for those applications, and will document a "how-to" usage guide for those interested in what he was using to collect his genealogical data for future traceability purposes. 
  
  I intend to use this information to add to some ancestry.com tress information, and intend to use the plethora of since-documented geneology information to augment his works and continue on with edits and additions to The Stump story, and website.
  
  Most importantly, I wanted to bring this all back to life here for my family, and to keep it alive, and add to it over time as I can only imagine he would've done himself. It's amazing to see the effort he put into learning HTML, learning our family history, and retelling the story of Légère Acadian heritage.

  Thanks for visiting!
