### A bit of background...
  
  My grandfather (Roger Colin Legere) gave me his geneology website (the former URL: `http://www.legerefamilytree.com/`) on a CD back in the early 2000s as a set of HTML files. Additionally, on that CD were the applications he had downloaded onto his computer which he'd used to generate family tree data via now-retired web services, websites and ancestry registries. 
  
  I've been working on getting everything working again for those applications, and will document a "how-to" usage guide for those interested in what he was using to collect his genealogical data for future traceability purposes. 
  
  Moreover, I intend to use this information to add to some ancestry.com tress information, and intend to use the plethora of since-documented geneology information to augment his works and continue on with edits and additions to The Stump story, and website.
  
  Most importantly, I wanted to bring this all back to life here for my family, and to keep it alive, and add to it over time as I can only imagine he would've done himself. It's amazing to see the effort he put into learning HTML, learning our family history, and retelling the story of Légère Acadian heritage.
