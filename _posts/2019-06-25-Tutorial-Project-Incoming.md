## Almost Done!

I'm just about done finishing my example and tutorial for Cucumber in Java which will show a few basic ways of using Cucumber, and instructions on how to set everything up and run it!

This is the part I enjoy most: creating the right display of information for a more general audience, with respect to word choice and layout. It's like creative documentation, but with an emphasis on communicability, in my mind, and is always a fun excercise. Nothing quite beats a good markdown README tutorial when done well on GitHub!
