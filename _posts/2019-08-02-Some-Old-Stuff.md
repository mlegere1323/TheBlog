## Old High School Code :D

Just found my old high school Java projects that used [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/door); one of my favorite teaching and learning tools that I've used in my coding journey so far. It's intelligently visual, and simple, and clean.

My projects are [here](https://www.greenfoot.org/users/2680), and include a Dance Dance Revolution type game, a Crab Game, and a Tron style Light Cycle game, all made in Java using Greenfoot as an IDE.
