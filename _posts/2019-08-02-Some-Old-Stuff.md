## Old High School Code :D 

* Just found my old high school Java projects that used [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/door); it's one of my favorite teaching and learning tools that I've used in my coding journey so far. It's intelligently visual, and simple, and clean.

**These games were so fun to make...**

 I'll probably download GreenFoot again to check them out!

* My projects are [here](https://www.greenfoot.org/users/2680), and include a [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) type game, a Crab Game, and a [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)) style Light Cycle game, all made in Java using Greenfoot as an IDE.
