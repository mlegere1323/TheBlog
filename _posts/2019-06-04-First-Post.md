## First Post!


To whomever reads this, thank you! This is my first post and I appreciate you scrolling by!


**Cucumber With Java!**: I've enjoyed learning Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) via Cucumber! This book (below) is a great read for those familiar with Java. I'm hoping to write a post with a closer look at some of the concepts soon; I've been enjoying re-reading it recently. Using cucumber to create an automation test suite to test an API at Wex has been one of my favorite projects to date!
