* **Robot Room**
  * A 3D graphics Javascript and WebGL project of mine with a room scene and a controllable robot in it. This project serves as framework for many basic concepts in 3D Graphics Programming.

* **Sense Weather**
  * A Python and Raspberry Pi Sense Hat application I developed for forecasting weather with a unique, pixelated, and aesthetically pleasing display, using pyOWM. This program will also measure local conditions with the built-in temperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors.

* **Wii Nunchuk Mouse**
  * A Python, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino program I developed to use my Wii Nunchuk controller as a computer mouse for my Raspberry Pi computer. Gyro/motion controls, and the joystick are both control options for moving the cursor across the screen.
